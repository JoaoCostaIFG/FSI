        "When did Europe become so afraid of China? Last month, the European Commission published its much-awaited new strategic outlook on China. The document offers up sweeping judgments on Chinas development strategy and 10 detailed responses. It is written in the usual technocratic jargon that is second, or even first, nature to officials in Brussels, but it also shows signs of a more political approach. China is described as a systemic rival, whose economic power and political influence have grown with unprecedented scale and speed. Theres been a significant change in Europes attitude to Beijing. Not too long ago, Europeans shrugged at Chinas rise. Overnight, it seems, their world changed. So, why did the tide turn? And how did we get here? First, there was the story of the solar panels. European producers once enjoyed a clear first-mover advantage, and yet the industry has been all but wiped out in Europe. Look at the list of the worlds 10 largest solar-panel manufacturers. In 2001, five were European. In 2018, eight were Chinese; the other two were Canadian and South Korean. Then there was Kuka, the crown jewel of German robotics, which was taken over by Chinese home-appliance maker Midea in 2016. What happened next has become part of a now recognizable pattern: Once a firm is acquired by a Chinese company, its European suppliers are abandoned for Chinese value chains.

U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing estimates that over the next two decades China will need 7,690 new planes, valued at $1.2 trillion. This is a huge opportunity for Chinas domestic industry, and Beijing has marked aerospace and aviation equipment as one of 10 strategic industries it is boosting through its Made in China 2025 initiative. Industry experts estimate that it will take China 10 years to be able to compete with Boeing and Airbus. But this doesnt mean China is far behind its Western competitors. Ten years will go by quickly. By 2030, the last holdouts will have fallen, and Europe will be under the imminent threat of being swallowed up by a country three or four times the size of the European Union. There is something predatory going on here. The question though is: Is it China? Or is this just the way the world works and has always worked? Things would be different if the EU were a genuine political union. Recently I had lunch with a British diplomat in Beijing. As I described what a Chinese-led world order might look like, he sat back in his chair and commented with a wry smile: Looks like the British empire to me. It also looks like the American empire. The British empire may be gone, but its American cousin is very much alive. As the recent trade war shows, once the United States feels threatened by China, it can bring Beijing to the negotiating table. Boeing may be as vulnerable to Chinese competition as Europes Airbus, but the company can count on America to come to its aid in an hour of need. The EU would not be able to muster a similar feat. It is too divided. Today, even a simple vote in the Council of the EU cant gather the necessary unanimity if the decision is seen to clash with Chinese interests in Europe. Countries such as Hungary or Greece long courted by China and keen to keep Beijing happy will veto it. Things would be different if the EU were a genuine political union there would be no Hungarian or Greek veto. Capitals would lose their competence in foreign policy and a fully democratic common power would be fully in charge of external relations. Europeans have been trying to achieve such a political union for the last 70 years, but is has remained an unfulfilled promise. Perhaps thats because the EU lacks the most basic ingredient of political unity: the fear of an external threat. Chinese President Xi Jinping accompanies French President Emmanuel Macron in Beijing, 2018 | Lintao Zhang via Getty Images The U.S. has played a critical and often overlooked role in eliminating this perception of a common enemy. By extending an unconditional security guarantee to its allies, it ensured that the Soviet Union would never become an existential threat to Europe. At the same time, American society and politics were too similar to Europes in their values and aims for Washingtons allies across the Atlantic to feel genuinely threatened by the extent of American power. This geopolitical limbo was comfortable enough. It allowed Europe to take a long holiday from history. It prevented a political union from becoming a necessity. Thats why Chinas rise is so important. It sets the stage for a great historical drama, one that will feature scenes in Lisbon, Shanghai and everywhere in between. And this time, Europe wont be able to rely on the U.S. being ready to sweep in with a deus ex machina. Even as China with its unrivaled economic and technological dynamism starts to look like a much greater threat to Europeans than the Soviet Union ever did, Washington does not seem to have either the capacity or the willingness to reprise its role from the Cold War. As in the famous play by Pirandello, European nations can be seen as a series of characters in search of an author. That search may be over. In China, they have found the external force that can bring them together. Bruno Maes, a former Europe minister for Portugal, is a senior adviser at Flint Global in London and a nonresident senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington. His book The Dawn of Eurasia was published by Penguin last year. Also On POLITICO ",
        "The author, Bruno Macaes, is an unusually astute observer with his own book \"Dawn of Eurasia\" that covers this topic at length.  He's from Portugal, a smaller recovering economy with a lot at stake in the health of EU.\nI find his Twitter feed very informative on this topic, and European policy makers would do well to heed his advice.",
        "There is an old diplomatic saying, \"Russia is never as strong as it looks and Russia is never as weak as it looks\".  China is the same.<p>China is a large, poor country with an aging population.  It is a badly run dictatorship that is more likely to return to warlordism than become a world power.<p>Australia and Canada are the primary targets for Chinese interference. Both are used for money laundering.  Uncle Xi is destroying the little political legitimacy from growing the economy.  The social credit system will further undermine the ability of China to move from a source of cheap labour to a more advanced economy.<p>China 2020 = Japan 1985."

        "Credit...Gilles Sabrie for The New York TimesJune 5, 2019BEIJING Chinas antitrust regulator on Wednesday announced a fine of around $25 million on Fords main joint venture in the country, the latest action against an American company amid the widening economic battle between China and the United States.Changan Ford, which is owned equally by the Detroit automaker and a state-backed Chinese company, was fined as Washington and Beijing have taken aim at each others businesses after the collapse of trade talks last month.First, the Trump administration barred American technology companies from selling to Huawei, the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecommunications equipment, denying it access to vital software, microchips and other components. Then, China said last week that it would create a blacklist of unreliable foreign companies and people who harm the interests of Chinese firms, without giving specifics.One giant American company is already feeling the pressure. Beijing is reportedly investigating FedEx over what the firm has called erroneous misrouting of some packages destined for Huawei addresses in Asia.It is not clear whether the move against Ford is directly connected to the broader clash with the United States. Chinas antimonopoly authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, said it was fining Changan Ford for setting minimum prices for its dealers in Chongqing, the inland metropolis where the company is based. That action deprived dealers of the autonomy to set their own prices, the government said.Chinese regulators have acted against other automakers on similar grounds in the past. Beijing has moved strongly in recent years to shape the way companies in many industries set prices for their products, hoping that this will encourage Chinese consumers to spend with greater confidence.But the Chinese government tends to enforce certain rules and regulations with greater vigor during times of geopolitical tension, particularly when foreign companies are involved, business groups in China say.Recently, the Chinese antitrust regulator left Qualcomm in prolonged limbo while it reviewed the American chip makers plan to acquire a Dutch competitor. Beijing never formally approved or denied the multibillion-dollar deal, causing it to be abandoned last year, after the Trump administration began raising tariffs on imports of Chinese goods. The authorities in eight other jurisdictions, including the United States, had already given their blessing to the deal. Chinese officials denied that the issue was related to the trade fight.In a statement on Wednesday, a Ford spokesman said Changan Ford had taken corrective action with respect to its sales policies.Changan Ford will continue to ensure its business activities contribute to a free and fair competitive environment, the statement said.Shares of the automaker fell about 2 percent in early trading Wednesday.Ford and other American automakers have been struggling in China of late. The country is the worlds largest market for cars, but the Chinese economy is slowing, and some assembly plants run by Detroit carmakers have been dismissing workers and running below capacity.Changan Ford was established in 2001, and it produces most of Fords main models in China. The number of cars it sold in April fell by more than 60 percent from a year earlier.Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, which represents manufacturers, said on Wednesday that the antitrust authoritys move against Changan Ford was a normal step to promote competition, and that it had nothing to do with conflicts with the United States. And indeed, the move is not out of sync with previous actions by the authorities in China.The Chinese antimonopoly regulatory authority has the flavor of a price regulator as well, Lester Ross, a partner at the Beijing office of the law firm WilmerHale, said.Its a peculiarity of the system here, he added. They pay attention to the welfare of the distributors and the welfare of retailers to a greater extent than the welfare of consumers.By contrast, the attitude of American regulators is generally that if you, as a consumer, dont like the price you are being charged for something, then you can go buy another product, Mr. Ross said. ",
        "can someone explain to me this \"trade war\" between the u.s. and china? as far as i can tell, it is an entirely constructed thing (in terms of how it started) and is simply the new \"war\" just like we had the cold war, war against drugs, war against terror, etc. so now the trade war is just the u.s.'s new war fetish.<p>so other than the current administration's idiotic approach to anything, what was the impetus of all of this?",
        "This is Changan Ford, meaning a JV where Ford controls exactly 49% and Changan 51%. The fine is for anti competitive behavior in setting a floor on resale values, and it seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to fine.<p>I don't think this is very related to the trade war, as it is hurting a Chinese company just as badly as an American one."

        "But he doesnt seem to be learning.Aug. 8, 2019Credit...Agence France-Presse Getty ImagesIf you want to understand the developing trade war with China, the first thing you need to realize is that nothing Donald Trump is doing makes sense. His views on trade are incoherent. His demands are incomprehensible. And he vastly overrates his ability to inflict damage on China while underrating the damage China can do in return.The second thing you need to realize is that Chinas response so far has been fairly modest and measured, at least considering the situation. The U.S. has implemented or announced tariffs on virtually everything China sells here, with average tariff rates not seen in generations. The Chinese, by contrast, have yet to deploy anything like the full range of tools at their disposal to offset Trumps actions and hurt his political base.Why havent the Chinese gone all out? It looks to me as if theyre still trying to teach Trump some economics. What theyve been saying through their actions, in effect, is: You think you can bully us. But you cant. We, on the other hand, can ruin your farmers and crash your stock market. Do you want to reconsider?There is, however, no indication that this message is getting through. Instead, every time the Chinese pause and give Trump a chance to rethink, he takes it as vindication and pushes even harder. What this suggests, in turn, is that sooner or later the warning shots will turn into an all-out trade and currency war.About Trumps views: His incoherence is on view almost every day, but one of his recent tweets was a perfect illustration. Remember, Trump has been complaining nonstop about the strength of the dollar, which he claims puts America at a competitive disadvantage. On Monday he got the Treasury Department to declare China a currency manipulator, which was true seven or eight years ago but isnt true now. Yet the very next day he wrote triumphantly that massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world is pouring into the United States, which he declared a beautiful thing to see.Um, what happens when massive amounts of money pour into your country? Your currency rises, which is exactly what Trump is complaining about. And if lots of money were flooding out of China, the yuan would be plunging, not experiencing the trivial (2 percent) decline that Treasury condemned.Oh well. I guess arithmetic is just a hoax perpetrated by the deep state.Still, even if Trump isnt making sense, will China give in to his demands? The short answer is, What demands? Trump mainly seems exercised by Chinas trade surplus with America, which has multiple causes and isnt really under the Chinese governments control.Others in his administration seem concerned by Chinas push into high-technology industries, which could indeed threaten U.S. dominance. But China is both an economic superpower and relatively poor compared with the U.S.; its grossly unrealistic to imagine that such a country can be bullied into scaling back its technological ambitions.Which brings us to the question of how much power the U.S. really has in this situation.America is, of course, a major market for Chinese goods, and China buys relatively little in return, so the direct adverse effect of a tariff war is larger for the Chinese. But its important to have a sense of scale. China isnt like Mexico, which sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States; the Chinese economy is less dependent on trade than smaller nations, and less than a fifth of its exports come to America.So while Trumps tariffs certainly hurt the Chinese, Beijing is fairly well placed to counter their effects. China can pump up domestic spending with monetary and fiscal stimulus; it can boost its exports, to the world at large as well as to America, by letting the yuan fall.At the same time, China can inflict pain of its own. It can buy its soybeans elsewhere, hurting U.S. farmers. As we saw this week, even a mostly symbolic weakening of the yuan can send U.S. stocks plunging.And Americas ability to counter these moves is hindered by a combination of technical and political factors. The Fed can cut rates, but not very much given how low they are already. We could do a fiscal stimulus, but having rammed through a plutocrat-friendly tax cut in 2017, Trump would have to make real concessions to Democrats to get anything more something he probably wont do.What about a coordinated international response? Thats unlikely, both because its not clear what Trump wants from China and because his general belligerence (not to mention his racism) has left America with almost nobody willing to take its side in global disputes.So Trump is in a much weaker position than he imagines, and my guess is that Chinas mini-devaluation of its currency was an attempt to educate him in that reality. But I very much doubt he has learned anything. His administration has been steadily hemorrhaging people who know anything about economics, and reports indicate that Trump isnt even listening to the band of ignoramuses he has left.So this trade dispute will probably get much worse before it gets better.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "Not too long ago, China taking your job meant its wages were far lower than Western alternatives, thus allowing it to steal blue-jean and iPhone factories.But what if it meant getting you fired for what you believe? Thats apparently what happened last week to Rebecca Sy, a long-serving flight attendant at a subsidiary of the Hong Kongbased airline Cathay Pacific. Her crime: supporting the pro-democracy protests engulfing Hong Kong on her Facebook page.Sys dismissal is just the most glaring example of a new stage in Beijings clampdown on widespread protests in the former British colonyarm-twisting Hong Kong companies to do the dirty work to ensure that their staff dont take part in the demonstrations that have gripped the city through the summer. By threatening shareholder returns and employees livelihoods, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders seem to believe that they can finally quell Hong Kongs demands for civil liberties.The consequences for Hong Kong are potentially dire. The city has thrived as Asias premier financial center and a favored destination for global companies because of its strong rule of law and trustworthy administrationcrucial elements for doing business that are sorely lacking in many other parts of the region, most of all China itself. But Beijings persistent efforts to bring the territory under its political thumb run the risk of undermining confidence in the one country, two system formula that governed Londons 1997 handover of the city to China and that ensures Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. Without it, Hong Kong would not be Hong Kong, and the pillars supporting its economy and society would crumble.More than that, Beijings pressure on Hong Kong companies could easily go global. If CCP cadres use their economic leverage over Hong Kong executives to stifle dissent against China, whats stopping them from doing the same to American, European, or Japanese managers worldwide? Here we find what may be the darkest side of the integration of authoritarian China into the global economy. Companies from Starbucks to Apple have become heavily reliant on Chinese consumers to drive revenue growth, and it is not unreasonable to think that Beijing could capitalize on those business interests to impose its political views on the world.Read: A defining moment for Trumps foreign policyTo an extent, Beijing already has. Its become almost routine for Hollywood producers to scrub scripts of anything that might offend thin-skinned Chinese censors and prevent a film from showing in lucrative Chinese theaters. Companies that accidentally tread on Chinese political sensitivitiesby, for instance, including Taiwan among countries on their websites (Beijing considers the island part of China)bring its ire upon them. Amid the Hong Kong scrape, Versace and Coach had to issue groveling apologies after angry Chinese perceived that they were listing the city as independent from China on their products.But the case of Sys firing shows that Beijing is turning up the heat further still. The CCP is intervening directly in the staffing decisions of firms, pitting managers against their own employees, and enforcing Beijings wishes in an area beyond the direct control of Chinas surveillance state.No company has come under greater distress than Cathay Pacific. Earlier this month, Chinas aviation authority ordered the airline to remove any cabin crew involved in Hong Kongs protests from flights to the mainland, claiming that such a step was meant to improve flight safety and security. Not complying was really not much of an option. Though Cathay Pacific is a major international carrier that flies everywhere from New York to New Delhi, a substantial part of its business is funneling passengers to China, especially on planes operated by its subsidiary Cathay Dragon.The Chinese edict threw the airline into turmoil. Several days later, Rupert Hogg, Cathays CEO, warned employees that the company had a zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities and threatened that staff participating in demonstrations could face termination. The airline quickly suspended a pilot involved in the protests. Hogg himself became a victim, unexpectedly resigning to take responsibility for the airlines woes.Read: Hong Kongs new realityThen came Sys sudden sacking. She claims that she was fired in a meeting with airline representatives after confirming that screenshots of Facebook posts were from her account, though she said she was given no explanation for her dismissal. (Later, Sy admitted publicly to posting pro-protest material on her Facebook page.) A Hong Kong union group called Sy's firing a blatant act of suppression.\" Why Sy was outright fired rather than reassigned to work that would not take her to China remains unclear. When I posed this question to a Cathay spokesman, the company replied in a statement that we cannot comment on individual cases, but then proceeded to do just that, saying Sys dismissal had nothing to do with her activities as the chief of a flight attendants union. More generally, the company added that such personnel decisions are based on all relevant circumstances including applicable regulatory requirements and the employees ability to perform his/her job.Meanwhile, the airline is suffering. Cathays shares, traded on the Hong Kong exchange, plunged in the days following Chinas edict (though they have since recouped the losses). Beijing is egging on the slide. Chinas largest state-owned bank downgraded Cathays stock to a strong sell last week.Similarly, MTR Corporation, which operates Hong Kongs subway system, faced intense criticism in Chinese state media for what was deemed too soft an attitude toward protesters in its train stations. Wilting in the spotlight, MTR said that it strongly condemns all acts of violence and illegal activities, and that it would shut stations without notice if necessary to control unrest.The so-called Big Four international accounting firms have also come under sharp scrutiny. After a group of unnamed employees published an advertisement supporting the protests, the firms quickly tried to distance themselves. We firmly oppose any action and statement that challenge national sovereignty, said PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the four. Unsatisfied, a story in the Global Times, a Communist Partyrun newspaper, demanded that the companies fire employees found to have the wrong stance on the current Hong Kong situation.Read: Chinas playbook in Hong Kong is also working in the Asia-PacificBy harassing these specific firms, Beijings leaders are clearly sending a wider message to all business in Hong Kong, both local and international: Support the crackdown, or suffer the consequences. A recent commentary in the Global Times made that threat explicit. Companies should not become accomplices of the rioters. Moreover, they need to see themselves as an important symbol of maintaining a stable and prosperous society, it read. Otherwise, behavior that hurts Chinese people's feelings are always eventually uncovered by netizens, and the companies guilty of such behavior are criticized or boycotted.For now, the pressure on these companies to act against democracy advocates has been limited to Hong Kong. Yet the businesses in Beijings crosshairs are also global, with employees and operations around the world. (Even MTR operates rail services in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden.) It is not such a big leap to fear staff working for these firms outside of Hong Kong could also be vulnerable if they express favor toward the protest movement.More broadly, CCP officials have influence over many of the worlds most prominent companies, which they could use to put management and their employees in a chokehold. Could they order General Motors or Nikeor any other international company with extensive business in Chinato fire a staffer who tweets support for the Dalai Lama or an independent Taiwan, with the threat of a canceled license or social-media boycott to force compliance? Of course, that would further alienate foreign companies already frustrated by unfair treatment and barriers to their business in the Chinese market. But as the crackdown in Hong Kong shows, the leadership in Beijing can place political control over economic reason. ",

        "Discussion a day ago: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20000034\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20000034</a>",
        "This is a suspended style, unlike the Japanese maglev- it's much more like the old transrapid[1] which used a set of coils underneath the track to pull up the train.  There are pros and cons to both.<p>The Japanese maglev uses large unpowered copper coils in the sidewalls[img:2].  They're arranged and interconnected in such a way that they keep the train up and centered.  They're quite expensive to build, but more energy efficient.<p>The suspension style can use smaller coils but they need their own power, which is lossy and can limit the length of the track.  In both cases the train typically needs its own generator to create all the power.<p>The article says that the plan is to make the cars very light, which is plausible- train cars are way heavier than needed; they weigh several times more (~1000 lbs/person) than the people and luggage they can fit.  The strength is important though, as the car needs to pull the rest of the train as well.  It may limit the number of passengers per train.<p>They'd have to build entirely new rail for the entire line from  Beijing to Shanghai.  That would be a very large investment, many times more expensive than just rail.  China is preparing for a never-before-seen level of infrastructure and doing anything they can to avoid cars, which would be an ecological and logistical disaster for them.<p>Maglevs are kind of questionable.  The use case comes from moving between large cities- plausible in America, but China already has some of the largest airports in the world and less of a middle class to use them.<p>1: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid</a><p>2: <a href=\"https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/maglev-train-test-track-e1487940220972-1200x767.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ma...</a>"

        "Reporting from ManilaGambling is illegal in China, but that didnt prevent Fan Zheng from betting tens of thousands of dollars online.The 30-year-old store clerk from the island province of Hainan learned about the opportunity early last year from marketing agents who, Fan believes, contacted him because he played no-stakes online card games.They knew I was a potential gambler, he said.At first, the agents persuaded him to bet on card games. That added thrill and a chance of making money to something he was already doing for fun.But the card games were slow, and Fan kept losing. The agents suggested that he try a game called Tencent Every-Minute-Lottery, which generates winning numbers based on the total users logged into a Chinese messaging app. As the name suggests, there is a new chance to win every minute.Soon he was hooked. Sometimes he bet $1.50. Other times, he bet $10,000.The more I played, the bigger amounts Id bet, he said.Operating safely out of reach of Chinese authorities, the lottery website and its agents are based hundreds of miles away in the Philippines.The Southeast Asian nation is being transformed by a massive surge in online gambling companies catering to players in China, where rising incomes have given more people the means to wager. (Oriental Game) The demand is expected to drive gambling revenue in the Philippines to $4.1 billion this year, up from just over $1 billion in 2016, according to the government.Those figures also include traditional casinos, which have gotten their own boost from rising tourism from China.Still, the revenue generated online pays salaries, rent, government bribes and other costs in the Philippines and has given the economy a significant boost. The annual licensing fees $140 million last year, more than 11 times the 2016 total are now the third-largest source of government revenue behind taxes and customs.The boom is most apparent here in the capital, where gambling companies and their employees have driven commercial and residential rents to record highs.By some estimates, at least 100,000 people from mainland China have moved to Manila for jobs as gambling company marketing agents, tech support specialists and engineers all to serve the Mandarin-speaking clientele.Everybody is after the Chinese customer because theyre the biggest market and theyre the biggest gamblers, said Rosalind Wade, the Manila-based managing director of Asia Gaming Brief, a research and consulting firm.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who once railed against the industry as a vector for crime, recently called for its expansion.that was the quote That gambling, gambling, Duterte told supporters at a recent rally, I cannot control it. :: (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) The story of the rise of offshore Chinese gambling in the Philippines starts in the world of bricks and mortar.Over the last decade, the country has built some of the regions largest casino resorts, none bigger than those located along Manila Bay in a development called Entertainment City.The gleaming gambling houses and hotels here have helped turn the Philippines into Asias third-most lucrative gambling destination, just behind Singapore and very far behind world-leading Macao.Chinese high rollers once would have scorned the idea of gambling in the Philippines. Then in 2016 Duterte announced his separation from the U.S. and realignment with China. Over the next two years, according to the Philippine tourism department, the annual number of Chinese tourists nearly doubled to 1.2 million.On a recent night at the City of Dreams casino, Chinese baccarat players were wagering tens of thousands of dollars a hand in VIP rooms.But the biggest bets were being placed remotely. Using computer tablets and headsets to communicate with gamblers watching from abroad on cameras, Mandarin-speaking female employees readied stacks of chips each worth more than $19,000 and waited patiently for instructions.Proxy betting, as the practice is called, is outlawed in all but only a handful of countries because little is known about the remote gamblers.That its welcome in the Philippines underscores the lengths the country will go to court Chinese money. (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) The online boom was set in motion when Duterte signed Executive Order No. 13 in 2016, stripping two small regional economic agencies of the authority to issue offshore gambling licenses and handing it to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp., which is both a national regulator and a gambling operator.Almost overnight, investors in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia seized the new opportunity to reach Chinese gamblers.Their online game of choice is baccarat. The sites also featured roulette and the Chinese dice game sic bo. Many feature livestreams with dealers at empty tables.Several sites each receive more than $3 million a day in deposits the money players transfer to the sites to bet with according to a gambling executive whose company provides payment software and operates a site that features virtual slot machines.He spoke on condition that his name not be published, because of the sensitivity of his business and how much was at stake. In less than a week, he said, one of his customers lost $300,000.:: (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) The faster the industry grows, the more it needs workers with the language skills and cultural know-how to indulge Chinese gamblers.At first, operators targeted Chinese students already in the Philippines.Eventually, that labor pool ran dry. Companies grew desperate and started recruiting outside train stations in China, where migrant job seekers would gather.Today, the industry uses social media or word of mouth to find labor.Nearly all in their early 20s, the workers are lured to the Philippines with lofty salaries and benefits such as free accommodations, meals and flights home.Its boring work, said one gambling site manager, who spoke on condition that he not be named because China regards his work as illegal. Its a lot of texting and calling. Some have to do it for 12-hour shifts. (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) The manager said the creature comforts of home have improved dramatically since he moved to Manila in 2011 to study English at a university there. He can now find his favorite spicy Hunan food with ease.For many of his employees, the job is their first taste of financial freedom.These are people who would have worked in factories if they didnt come here, the manager said.The appearance of so many college-age foreigners makes some residents uneasy. Philippine professionals complain about the workers being rowdy, their penchant for smoking and their lack of English. Others scoff that some of the newest high-paying jobs in the Philippines are going to foreigners while millions of Filipinos continue to have to go overseas to seek employment.The cultural differences are the main reason theres hostility, said Dana Krizia Mengote Sandoval, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Immigration. (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) (Eloisa Lopez / For The Times) Now theyre seeing Chinese people firsthand, she said. Its more personal.Property owners have naturally been more welcoming. Real estate prices around Manila have soared 40% since offshore gambling took off in 2016.Some gambling operators, scrambling to find office space and apartments for their workers, are providing a years worth of rent in advance, according to David Leechiu, who heads a Manila-based real estate firm.The Chinese presence, he said, is helping beckon investors from China and parts of Southeast Asia.We can call it a Chinese invasion, but its more than that. Its the Philippines opening up to the world.:: Both the Philippines and China have overlooked their own laws to allow the industry to thrive.The law stipulates that the sites are not allowed to target any country where gambling is banned.Kickbacks are also common. One former security consultant for a gambling operator in Manila said the company paid $500,000 to $1 million a month in bribes.Legislators, law enforcement, immigration officials, they all came asking for handouts because they knew the money was coming from China, said the consultant, who spoke anonymously because of a confidentiality agreement.For its part, Beijing has done little to pressure the Philippines to stop targeting China. Nor has it moved to break up the black-market banking system the industry relies on.Rural Chinese residents are recruited to open accounts at major commercial banks in exchange for a nominal fee. Then agents tell gamblers where to deposit their money. The transactions are then masked as retail purchases for everyday items like phone cards or shoes.That ultimately leaves the gamblers vulnerable.Within a few months after he started playing the lottery game, Fan was in debt and began borrowing from friends, family and online lenders. When he couldnt make payments on one loan, hed open a credit card or borrow from another online lender.Then one day last June, he got lucky and hit a major payout that would have covered his $150,000 in losses. But when it came time to collect, his account was suddenly canceled. His agent in the Philippines disappeared.Fan considered going to the police, but thought better of it. What hes done was illegal, after all.They might arrest me, Fan said. Im definitely not going to play anymore. Im going to slowly do my regular work, try to make money and pay it back.Pierson reported from Manila and Su from Beijing.david.pierson@latimes.com | Follow me @dhpierson ",

        "Censorship in the country is more complicated than many Westerners imagine.Aaron Tam / AFP / GettyAbout the authors: Amy Hawkins is a freelance journalist based in Beijing whose writings have appeared in publications such as Foreign Policy, the Guardian, and the TLS. Jeffrey Wasserstrom is Chancellors Professor of History at UC Irvine and is the author of Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink. Last winter, after the Chinese Communist Party announced the abolition of presidential term limits, Beijing temporarily moved to censor social-media references to George Orwells Animal Farm and 1984. The governments concern was that activists would use these titles to charge, in not-so-subtle code, that China was moving in a decidedly authoritarian direction. But censors did not bother to ban the sale of these texts either in bookstores or online. It wasand remainsas easy to buy 1984 and Animal Farm in Shenzhen or Shanghai as it is in London or Los Angeles.The different treatment of these texts and their titles helps illuminate the complicated reality of censorship in China. Its less comprehensive, less boot-on-the-faceas Orwell might have put itand quirkier than many Westerners imagine.Censors have banned books simply for containing a positive or even neutral portrayal of the Dalai Lama. The government disallows the publication of any work by Liu Xiaobo, the determined critic of the Communist Party who in 2017 became the first Nobel Peace Prize winner since Nazi times to die in prison. Again, for a time last year Chinese citizens could not type 19, 80, and four in sequencebut they could, and still can, buy a copy of 1984, the most famous novel on authoritarianism ever written. Prefer Aldous Huxleys Brave New World? They can buy that text, too, just as easily, although its title also joined the taboo list last winter.Read: What its like teaching 1984 after Trumps electionHeres the rub: Monitors pay closer attention to material that might be consumed by the average person than to cultural products seen as highbrow and intended for educated groups. (An internet forum versus an old novel.) As a result, Chinese writers are watched more closely than foreign ones. (Liu Xiaobo versus Orwell.) Another rule of thumb is that more leeway is given to imaginative works about authoritarianism than ones that specifically engage with its manifestations in post-1949 China. (1984 versus a book on the Dalai Lama.)When a book crosses some lines but not others, censors generally use a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer. That explains the status of Brave New World Revisited, Huxleys nonfiction work in which he argued that autocrats in the Soviet Union and China were combining the rule-through-distraction techniques outlined in Brave New World and the rule-through-fear methods detailed in 1984. Chinese readers on the mainland can find copies of this highbrow book by a foreigner pretty easilybut censors have surgically excised all direct references to Maos China.These patterns may suggest that censors take a rather dim view of their audiences abilitiesthat they believe Chinese citizens are unable to draw a connection between the political situation Orwell described and the nature of their government (unless prompted to do so by a rabble-rouser on the internet). More likely, theyre motivated by elitism, or classism. Analogously, in the United States the MPAA slaps movies with an R rating if they depict nudity, but theres no warning system for museums that display nude sculptures. The assumption is not that Chinese people cant figure out the meaning of 1984, but that the small number of people who will bother to read it wont pose much of a threat.At an elite level, the rules in China have always been and still are more relaxed. When the first simplified-character Chinese translation of 1984 was published in 1979, it was kept in a special section of libraries and bookstores that was off-limits to most people. The laobaixingthe common peoplecouldnt get their hands on the book until 1985. Today, graduate students can have much more nuanced and frank discussions about controversial periods in Chinese history than even college undergraduates.Conor Friedersdorf: The speech that Facebook plans to punishThere are three basic reasons for these disparities: Elites must by definition have skin in the game in relation to the ruling party; the government knows it cant really stop well-connected, highly educated citizens from acquiring the information they want, in part because theyre able to travel abroad and expose themselves to a variety of materials there; and the authorities are aware that a touch of liberty is often better than a boot in the face to keep people in line.Western commentators often give the impression that Chinese censorship is more comprehensive than it really is, due, in part, to a veritable obsession with the governments handling of the so-called three Ts of Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen. A 2013 article in The New York Review of Books states, for example, that to this day Tiananmen is one of the neuralgic words forbiddennot always successfullyon Chinas Internet. Any book, article, or social-media post that so much as mentions these words, the conventional wisdom holds, is liable to disappear.Even when it comes to the three Ts, though, things are a bit less simple than they appear. Contra The New York Review of Books, references to Tiananmen as a place, a tourist attraction, and so on fill the web in China. Whats verboten is reference to the killings that took place around there, or to the date of the 1989 massacre, June 4. Moreover, although on the mainland no bookstore would dare stock a work by a Chinese author that mentions the massacre, there is some discussion of this taboo topic in the mainland translation of a biography of Deng Xiaoping by Ezra Vogel, a prominent American scholar.The governments approach to contentious individuals can be as surprising as its approach to contentious texts. On occasion, the government cracks down fiercely. The exiled writer Ma Jian, who has compared Xis China to 1984, told The New York Times that, to Chinese readers, I am a dead man, referring to the total ban on his books on the mainland. In July of last year, the political cartoonist Jiang Yefei was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for inciting subversion of state power and illegally crossing the border.Read: The age of reverse censorshipBut some writers, including Chan Koonchung, occupy a more liminal space. His most famous book, The Fat Years, is banned on the mainland because it invokes (indirectly) the collective, state-sponsored amnesia of the 1989 massacre near Tiananmen Square. Nevertheless, in October, he was allowed to host a BBC radio event in Beijing, which was open to the public. There he discussed, among other things, the debt his novel owed to Orwell and Huxley. Although the program was conducted in English, the audience was majority Chinese. And many audience members had managed to read this banned novel, whether by obtaining a copy from Taiwan or Hong Kong, or by downloading the pirated version that lived online for six months before censors scrubbed it away.Chan said recently over the phone from his home in Beijing that, although he was anxious about the event, he hopes that his avoidance of specifically political activities will help protect him: The only thing I do is write. I dont join any groups or sign petitions. Apart from writing, I do nothing. Thats the only thing I do, and I have to keep doing it.Perhaps the most famous writer to live in Chinas limbo between freedom and oppression is Yan Lianke, the subject of a recent New Yorker profile by Jiayang Fan. Yan lives in Beijing, teaches at the prestigious Renmin University, and is considered a hero in his home village in Henan, a poor, northern province. His most famous works include Serve The People!, a satire of the Cultural Revolution that features vivid sex scenes, and Dream of Ding Village, which deals with the taboo subject of the AIDS crisis that ravaged Henan in the 1990s. Both are banned on the Chinese mainland, although Fan notes that the ban is de facto rather than official, and his less tendentious titles remain somewhat available.The somewhat is key: It is rare for the government to ban an authors oeuvre in its entirety. Publishers have some leeway to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, and a publisher in Shanghai may come to a different conclusion than a publisher in Sichuan. These disparities are a result of individual judgement calls and the specific relationships between publishers and their local censorship authorities.When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the first thing some East Berliners did was rush to fabled West Berlin department stores. One reason the Chinese Communist Party has outlived so many predictions of its imminent demise, in the wake of what the political scientist Ken Jowitt dubbed the Leninist extinction, is that Chinas leaders have been intent since the early 1990s to allow citizens at least partial access to consumer goods, including cultural products, that are available to their counterparts in other parts of the world. They know that if they keep the lid on too tight, they could stoke envy, and that envy could turn into a serious political problem. ",
        "'1984' and 'Brave New World' are not within the periphery of consideration of everyday dissidents when talking about authoritarianism or protest in China (it's not part of the currency).  If these tomes became a tool and entered the consciousness or became a vehicle for discussion and dissent then they would be banned.  Why ban something almost no one is entirely aware of.  It'd be like Iran banning Chinese authors.  It makes little sense.  It's not pragmatic."

        "Tech Were UsingLi Yuan conducts much of her work on the WeChat mobile app, including spotting trends and prodding sources to get back to her.Credit...Kenneth Tsang for The New York TimesJan. 9, 2019How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Li Yuan, a technology columnist in Hong Kong, discussed the tech shes using.You write about Chinese tech. What tech tools do you rely on to do your job, and what do you like about them?Its not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat, the messaging app thats the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things. As my iPhone battery use record shows, I spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on WeChat. That doesnt include the two to three hours I use WeChats web version.Im not alone in my heavy WeChat use. There are 800 million internet users in China, but over one billion WeChat accounts. Just about every Chinese online has at least one account, and some more than one. Over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day. The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many peoples lives and work. Two years ago, I met two people who refused to use WeChat, and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life. Before I got around to it, both became my WeChat friends.So as a journalist, I have to hang out on WeChat. I message and call my sources on WeChat. I keep an eye on WeChat Moment, which is similar to Facebook Timeline, and group chats so Ill always be on top of whats going on in China. When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me, I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they arent so busy.By now, some readers must be screaming, How about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat? Sadly, its just the way of life in China. Im not trying to make light of the issue. Ive been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public. But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance. ImageCredit...Kenneth Tsang for The New York TimesIve tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but havent had much success. I also use Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there. But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts, I dont use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs. But Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends. Thats where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google, Facebook or Twitter.How do people in China use tech differently, compared with people in the United States?The first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are. Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC, and their first computer was their smartphone. Email never really took off in China. Some big corporations do use it. But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick response.Because of WeChats prevalence, few Chinese carry business cards any more. At many meetings in China, theres a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become friends. I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards. Because its a social media platform, you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles.Many businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account. A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit. I dont know how they manage so many contacts.Generally, Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products, including mobile apps. Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its move fast and break things mantra. Many people in Chinas internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first.Why are mobile wallets so popular in China?When I moved from New York to Beijing in 2008, China was still a cash-based nation. Not many people had credit cards, and it wasnt easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines. I used to have to go to the A.T.M.s all the time. Going to the banks, mostly giant state-owned enterprises, was torturously time-consuming. Then came WeChat Pay and Alipay, the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba. Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes, it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments.ImageCredit...Kenneth Tsang for The New York TimesMobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China, including small towns. Ive been carrying a 100-yuan ($15) bill in my wallet for months but havent found an occasion to use it. Everybody hotels, department stores, taxi drivers, noodle stands takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both. Even tollbooths accept mobile payment. What are some hot new apps, tech products or internet services in China?The hottest app is a short video service, Douyin, which is called TikTok outside China. As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column, its a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment Carpool Karaoke.To be honest, Im too old for the app Douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings and have not spent much time on it. But Ive seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy. Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day, which I would argue is the downside of the app. Its parent company, Bytedance, is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users viewing history.The short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyins rival, Kwai. Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside. You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses. I call Kwai the Hillbilly Elegy of China. Its where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal cities.Outside of work, what tech product are you into right now? Im a very low-tech person! While my iPhone feels like an extension of my left arm, I dont use many other electronics. I didnt own a TV until a year ago and only watch Netflix sometimes. I bought a microwave this year, and its the simplest model because I knew I would use it only to reheat food.My biggest tech wish is for Google, Facebook, Apple or another company to build a technology that can break the Great Firewall, the system of filters and blocks that prevents Chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites. Instead of kowtowing to the Chinese governments demands in order to gain access to the market, American tech giants could do something heroic: Liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darkness. ",
        "If you're a foreigner, getting a functioning WeChat account is near to impossible these days. Validating a foreign account involves sponsorship from a local account. Local accounts can only sponsor one user every three months.<p>This is a policy that has been getting steadily more and more restrictive. I have partners who simply give westerners a telephone with a new account + Sim loaded and bound to a local to avoid hassles.<p>Life in China today without WeChat is a bit like life in the USA today but communicating only by postal mail and paying for things with traveller's cheques. It's possible, but it's not a world you want to live in.<p>If WeChat is taking over the world.. it's a world without foreigners.",
        "The combination of Wechat and making it effectively the only option through the Great Firewall is an amazing tool for shutting out foreign voices from Chinese social media.  The apparent policy on connecting to Wechat from outside the mainland is \"don't\".<p>It seems incredible that people would want to use such a restrictive service when much more open ones exist, but the others routinely have their service degraded by the government so they aren't a viable option.<p>Personally, it think in the long term this sort of compartmentalization is harmful, it too often facilitates groupthink and missing valuable input from people with a different perspective.  It's damaging to a society and is going to have repercussions."

        "We thought economic growth and technology would liberate China. Instead, it corrupted us.Oct. 9, 2019Credit...Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThe Peoples Republic of China is the largest, most powerful and arguably most brutal totalitarian state in the world. It denies basic human rights to all of its nearly 1.4 billion citizens. There is no freedom of speech, thought, assembly, religion, movement or any semblance of political liberty in China. Under Xi Jinping, president for life, the Communist Party of China has built the most technologically sophisticated repression machine the world has ever seen. In Xinjiang, in Western China, the government is using technology to mount a cultural genocide against the Muslim Uighur minority that is even more total than the one it carried out in Tibet. Human rights experts say that more than a million people are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, two million more are in forced re-education, and everyone else is invasively surveilled via ubiquitous cameras, artificial intelligence and other high-tech means.None of this is a secret. Under Xi, China has grown markedly more Orwellian; not only is it stamping its heel more firmly on its own citizens, but it is also exporting its digital shackles to authoritarians the world over. Yet unlike the way we once talked about pariah nations say East Germany or North Korea or apartheid South Africa American and European lawmakers, Western media and the worlds largest corporations rarely treat China as what it plainly is: a growing and existential threat to human freedom across the world.Why do we give China a pass? In a word: capitalism. Because for 40 years, the Wests relationship with China has been governed by a strategic error the dimensions of which are only now coming into horrific view.[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]A parade of American presidents on the left and the right argued that by cultivating China as a market hastening its economic growth and technological sophistication while bringing our own companies a billion new workers and customers we would inevitably loosen the regimes hold on its people. Even Donald Trump, who made bashing China a theme of his campaign, sees the country mainly through the lens of markets. Hell eagerly prosecute a pointless trade war against China, but when it comes to the millions in Hong Kong who are protesting Chinas creeping despotism over their territory, Trump prefers to stay mum.Well, funny thing: It turns out the Wests entire political theory about China has been spectacularly wrong. China has engineered ferocious economic growth in the past half century, lifting hundreds of millions of its citizens out of miserable poverty. But Chinas growth did not come at any cost to the regimes political chokehold.A darker truth is now dawning on the world: Chinas economic miracle hasnt just failed to liberate Chinese people. It is also now routinely corrupting the rest of us outside of China.This was the theme of the N.B.A.s hasty and embarrassing apology this week after Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager, tweeted and quickly deleted a message in support of Hong Kongs protesters. After an outcry from American lawmakers, Adam Silver, the N.B.A.s commissioner, later seemed to backtrack on his genuflection.But I wasnt comforted. The N.B.A. is far from the first American institution to accede to Chinas limits on liberty. Hollywood, large tech companies and a variety of consumer brands from Delta to Zara have been more than willing to play ball. The submission is spreading: This week the American video game company Blizzard suspended a player for calling for the liberation of Hong Kong in a live-stream. And according to Deadspin, ESPN a network owned by Disney, which has worked closely with the Chinese government on some big deals in China warned anchors against discussing Chinese politics in talking about the Rockets controversy.This sort of corporate capitulation is hardly surprising. For Western companies, China is simply too big and too rich a market to ignore, let alone to pressure or to police. If the first and most important cost of doing business in China is the surgical extraction of a C.E.O.s spine, many businesses are only too happy to provide the stretcher and the scalpel.But it will only get worse from here, and we are fools to play this game. There is a school of thought that says America should not think of China as an enemy. With its far larger population, Chinas economy will inevitably come to eclipse ours, but that is hardly a mortal threat. In climate change, the world faces a huge collective-action problem that will require global cooperation. According to this view, treating China like an adversary will only frustrate our own long-term goals.But this perspective leaves out the threat that greater economic and technological integration with China poses to everyone outside of China. It ignores the ever-steeper capitulation that China requires of its partners. And it overlooks the most important new factor in the Chinese regimes longevity: the seductive efficiency that technology offers to effect a breathtaking new level of control over its population.There was a time when Westerners believed that the internet would be the Communist regimes ruin. In a speech in 2000 urging Congress to normalize trade relations with China, President Bill Clinton famously quipped: Theres no question China has been trying to crack down on the internet. Good luck! Thats sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. The crowd of foreign policy experts erupted in knowing laughter.China proved them wrong. It didnt just find a way to nail Jell-O; it became a Jell-O master carpenter. Through online surveillance, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and the propagandistic gold mine of social media, China has mobilized a set of tools that allow it to invisibly, routinely repress its citizens and shape political opinion by manipulating their feelings and grievances on just about any controversy.This set of skills horrifies me. China may not be exporting its political ideology, but through lavish spending and trade, it is expanding its influence across the planet. There is a risk that Chinas success becomes a kind of template for the world. In the coming decades, instead of democracy which you may have noticed is not having such a hot run on either side of the Atlantic Chinese-style tech-abetted surveillance authoritarianism could become a template for how much of the world works.I should say there were a couple of small reasons for optimism regarding the spread of Chinese tyranny. The bipartisan outrage over the N.B.A.s initial apology to China did suggest American lawmakers arent willing to give China a completely free pass. The Trump administration also did something clever, placing eight Chinese surveillance technology companies and several police departments on a blacklist forbidding them from trading with American companies.But if we are to have any hope of countering Chinas dictatorial apparatus, well need a smarter and more sustained effort from our leaders.

        "One of the surprising things to me is how much China seems to have played their hand too early (and too strongly). People have been sounding alarms about China for a while but if they had played it cool everything likely would’ve ticked along as it was. Everyone would still ignore the human rights abuses, and IP theft, and creeping influence in our institutions around the world, etc. Instead China has managed to really put it right in front of every average persons face and now there’s a real chance things could shift away from China. And what for? Ego? On the one hand I think the CCP bought a dud with Chairman Xi. But maybe that’s good for the rest of us.",
        "In this light of recent heat up of issues with China, I want to share a positive story to contrast: I had a daily driver in Chengdu for over 1 month who spoke no English, zero, none at all - not even \"yes\" or \"no\". We communicated via Google translate (on VPN). He would play Chinese music and then some days I would play some American rock and roll. We bonded in inexplicable ways. I had always commented on how I love the carved wooden letter that hangs on the taxi's rear-view mirror. The ride was almost 1 hour in the morning and 2 hours in the evening back to the Hotel. We became friends. On the last day, he took the wooden ornament off, cupped it in his palm, held it against his chest, gave it to me with a glimmer in his eyes. Fuck, that was the most amazing human connection I've ever made.<p>I've worked in China in the semiconductor business, stayed there and absorbed some of the things the west does not even know. I recommend reading \"Poorly Made in China (2011)\" by Paul Midler. It is <i>surprisingly</i> good - factual, objective look of deep issues with China's way of doing things. I resonate with the book with my personal experience.<p>Diplomacy is about being able to negotiate well, build trust and foster long term relationships, acknowledge mutual interests, differences and work towards solutions to problems. China has lost the brand image, probably forever. Despite a few positive experiences on the individual level, I hate working with Chinese businesses and would never want to go there. Fuck the Chinese government and its tentacles (Chinese corporations). The Chinese leadership does not understand that leadership is about inspiring others, taking care of the weak, keeping your promises and being able to independently think, innovate and set an example for other nations to follow. The way it is going, I can guarantee with certainty that they can have all the financial leverage, moral leverage is what you need in the long term; they can never become a superpower.<p>Edit: grammar"

        "Credit...Ng Han Guan/Associated PressMay 22, 2019KASHGAR, China A Gods-eye view of Kashgar, an ancient city in western China, flashed onto a wall-size screen, with colorful icons marking police stations, checkpoints and the locations of recent security incidents. At the click of a mouse, a technician explained, the police can pull up live video from any surveillance camera or take a closer look at anyone passing through one of the thousands of checkpoints in the city.To demonstrate, she showed how the system could retrieve the photo, home address and official identification number of a woman who had been stopped at a checkpoint on a major highway. The system sifted through billions of records, then displayed details of her education, family ties, links to an earlier case and recent visits to a hotel and an internet cafe.The simulation, presented at an industry fair in China, offered a rare look at a system that now peers into nearly every corner of Xinjiang, the troubled region where Kashgar is located.This is the vision of high-tech surveillance precise, all-seeing, infallible that Chinas leaders are investing billions of dollars in every year, making Xinjiang an incubator for increasingly intrusive policing systems that could spread across the country and beyond.It is also a vision that some of President Trumps aides have begun citing in a push for tougher action against Chinese companies in the intensifying trade war. Beyond concerns about market barriers, theft and national security, they argue that China is using technology to strengthen authoritarianism at home and abroad and that the United States must stop it.Developed and sold by the China Electronics Technology Corporation, a state-run defense manufacturer, the system in Kashgar is on the cutting edge of what has become a flourishing new market for technology that the government can use to monitor and subdue millions of Uighurs and members of other Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.Treating a city like a battlefield, the platform was designed to apply the ideas of military cyber systems to civilian public security, Wang Pengda, a C.E.T.C. engineer, said in an official blog post. Looking back, it truly was an idea ahead of its time.The system taps into networks of neighborhood informants; tracks individuals and analyzes their behavior; tries to anticipate potential crime, protest or violence; and then recommends which security forces to deploy, the company said.On the screen during the demonstration was a slogan: If someone exists, there will be traces, and if there are connections, there will be information.ImageCredit...Paul Mozur/The New York TimesA New York Times investigation drawing on government and company records as well as interviews with industry insiders found that China is in effect hard-wiring Xinjiang for segregated surveillance, using an army of security personnel to compel ethnic minorities to submit to monitoring and data collection while generally ignoring the majority Han Chinese, who make up 36 percent of Xinjiangs population.It is a virtual cage that complements the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang where the authorities have detained a million or more Uighurs and other Muslims in a push to transform them into secular citizens who will never challenge the ruling Communist Party. The program helps identify people to be sent to the camps or investigated, and keeps tabs on them when they are released.The Trump administration is considering whether to blacklist one of the Chinese companies at the center of the Xinjiang effort, Hikvision, and bar it from buying American technology. Hikvision is a major manufacturer of video surveillance equipment, with customers around the world and across Xinjiang, where its cameras have been installed at mosques and detention camps. C.E.T.C. owns about 42 percent of the company through subsidiaries.Xinjiang is maybe a kind of more extreme, more intrusive example of Chinas mass surveillance systems, said Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch who has studied the technology in the region. These systems are designed for a very explicit purpose to target Muslims.ImageCredit...Paul Mozur/The New York TimesVirtual fencesIn the city of Kashgar, with a population of 720,000 about 85 percent of them Uighur the C.E.T.C. platform draws on databases with 68 billion records, including those on peoples movements and activities, according to the demonstration viewed by a Times reporter at the industry fair, held in the eastern city of Wuzhen in late 2017.By comparison, the F.B.I.s national instant criminal background check system contained about 19 million records at the end of 2018.The police in Xinjiang use a mobile app, made by C.E.T.C. for smartphones running the Android operating system, to enter information into the databases.Human Rights Watch, which obtained and analyzed the app, said it helped the authorities spot behavior that they consider suspicious, including extended travel abroad or the use of an unusual amount of electricity.The app, which the Times examined, also allows police officers to flag people they believe have stopped using a smartphone, have begun avoiding the use of the front door in coming and going from home, or have refueled someone elses car.The police use the app at checkpoints that serve as virtual fences across Xinjiang. If someone is tagged as a potential threat, the system can be set to trigger an alarm every time he or she tries to leave the neighborhood or enters a public place, Human Rights Watch said.The governments arbitrary power is reflected, or coded, in the app, Ms. Wang said, adding that the system is programmed to consider vague, broad categories of behaviors, many of them perfectly legal, as indicators of suspiciousness.Intelligence agencies in many countries use sets of behavior to single out individuals for greater scrutiny. But China has taken that approach to an extreme, treating the Muslim population in Xinjiang as suspect from the start and defining suspicious behavior in sweeping terms, including peaceful religious activities such as making a donation to a mosque.The Chinese government has defended the surveillance program, saying it has improved security in the region, and says the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang are job training centers. Hikvision has denied any inappropriate actions in Xinjiang, and C.E.T.C. declined to comment when reached by phone.C.E.T.C. traces its roots to the military research labs that helped build Chinas first nuclear bomb, satellite and guided missile. Established as a state defense manufacturer in 2002, it soon expanded into civilian security matters, working with Microsoft, for instance, to create a version of Windows that meets the governments internal security requirements.In recent years, it turned to Xinjiang.The Communist Party, which took control of the region in 1949, has long been wary of the Uighurs, whose Turkic culture and Muslim faith have inspired demands for self-rule, and sometimes attacks on Chinese targets. State investment in surveillance took off a decade ago after anti-Chinese rioting in the regional capital, Urumqi, killed nearly 200 people.The real bonanza of security contracts came after Xi Jinping took the helm of the party in late 2012. Spending on internal security in Xinjiang totaled nearly $8.4 billion in 2017, six times as much as in 2012, including funds for surveillance, personnel and the indoctrination camps.Hikvision has received contracts in Xinjiang worth at least $290 million for its cameras and facial recognition systems. Another company tapping into Xinjiangs security gold rush is Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that the United States has described as a security threat. It signed an agreement last year with the regions police department to help officers analyze data.ImageCredit...Andy Wong/Associated PressThe goal here is instilling fearThe multilayered program to harvest information from Uighurs and other Muslims begins on the edges of towns and cities across Xinjiang in buildings that look like toll plazas.Instead of coins, they collect personal information.On a recent visit to one checkpoint in Kashgar, a line of passengers and drivers, nearly all Uighur, got out of their vehicles, trudged through automated gates made by C.E.T.C. and swiped their identity cards.Head up, the machines chimed as they photographed the motorists and armed guards looked on.There are smaller checkpoints at banks, parks, schools, gas stations and mosques, all recording information from identity cards in the mass surveillance database.Identification cards are also needed to buy knives, gasoline, phones, computers and even sugar. The purchases are entered into a police database used to flag suspicious behavior or individuals, according to a 2017 dissertation by a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences that features screenshots of the system in Kashgar.Not everyone has to endure the inconvenience. At many checkpoints, privileged groups Han Chinese, Uighur officials with passes, and foreign visitors are waved through green channels. In this way, the authorities have created separate yet overlapping worlds on the same streets and in the online police databases one for Muslim minorities, the other for Han Chinese.The goal here is instilling fear fear that their surveillance technology can see into every corner of your life, said Wang Lixiong, a Chinese author who has written about Xinjiang as well as Chinas surveillance state. The amount of people and equipment used for security is part of the deterrent effect.A database stored online by SenseNets, a Chinese surveillance company, and examined by the Times suggests the scale of surveillance in Xinjiang: It contained facial recognition records and ID scans for about 2.5 million people, mostly in Urumqi, a city with a population of about 3.5 million.This can be pulled off by anyone, and thats the part that worries me, said Victor Gevers, a Dutch security researcher and co-founder of GDI Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes internet security.According to Mr. Gevers, who discovered the unsecured database, the online records indicate that a network of about 10,000 checkpoints in Urumqi made more than six million identifications in 24 hours.The authorities in Xinjiang also sometimes force residents to install an app known as Clean Net Guard on their phones to monitor for content that the government deems suspicious.Kashgar and other areas of Xinjiang have in recent years systematically collected DNA and other biological data from residents too, especially Muslims. Officials now collect blood, fingerprints, voice recordings, head portraits from multiple angles, and scans of irises, which can provide a unique identifier like fingerprints.These databases are not yet completely integrated, and despite the futuristic gloss of the Xinjiang surveillance state, the authorities rely on hundreds of thousands of police officers, officials and neighborhood monitors to gather and enter data.We risk understating the extent to which this high-tech police state continues to require a lot of manpower, said Adrian Zenz, an independent researcher who has studied security spending in Xinjiang. It is the combination of manpower and technology that makes the 21st-century police state so powerful.ImageCredit...Gilles Sabri for The New York TimesExpanding beyond the regionXinjiangs security and surveillance systems are already attracting admirers from the rest of China. Delegations of police officers from other provinces and cities have visited Kashgar and other cities to admire and consider adopting the measures.They often visit police command centers where rows of officers peer at computers, scanning surveillance video feeds and information on residents on the C.E.T.C. platform.The digitalization of police work has achieved leap-like growth in Xinjiang, Zhang Ping, a counterterrorism officer from Jiujiang, a city in southeastern China, said during a visit to Xinjiang last year, according to an official report on the website of the citys police bureau.Xinjiangs high-tech policing, he added, was something we should vigorously study.Zhejiang and Guangdong, two wealthy provinces on Chinas southeastern coast, have been testing the C.E.T.C. surveillance system used in Xinjiang, laying a robust foundation for a nationwide rollout, the company said last year.C.E.T.C. has also signed an agreement with the police in the southern city of Shenzhen to provide an advanced command center information system similar to the one in Xinjiang.The technology has some way to go. Dust and bad lighting can hobble facial recognition on security cameras, which struggle to track large numbers of people simultaneously. Even the best systems can be accurate in less than 20 percent of cases, according to one study published by a journal linked to the Ministry of Public Security.A technician who until recently installed and maintained computers for the authorities in Xinjiang said police surveillance centers relied on hundreds of workers to monitor cameras, an expensive and inefficient undertaking.And outside urban centers, police officers often do not have the skills to operate the sophisticated systems, said the technician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions for speaking to a journalist.The spending spree on security in Xinjiang has left local governments across the region with staggering bills, raising questions about how the authorities can keep the systems running.In Kashgar, for example, the county of Yengisar warned this year of a huge shortfall from spending on security and said that it had accumulated 1 billion renminbi, or about $150 million, in previously undeclared invisible debt.The pressure from ensuring basic spending for additional staff and to maintain stability is extraordinary, it said.Still, the regions leaders told officials this year that they must not wind back spending.Preserving stability is a hard-and-fast task that takes priority over everything else, the leadership said in the regions annual budget report. Use every possible means to find funds so that the high-pressure offensive does not let up. ",
        "Most Deep Learning papers related to tracking human pose, identifying abnormal behavior, detecting crime from video feeds etc. have Chinese authors. Literally bleeding-edge stuff used to subdue people. Can't wait to see some western politicians to hop on the same train once this tech is cheap after China beta-tests it and irons out all the quirks.",
        "Subdue? Not sure of that. But this is ironic on a number of levels. First, China's crackdown on Xinjiang followed a prolonged (multi-decade) period of low intensity guerilla resistance to their occupation that essentially garnered no international reporting. Second, everywhere else in China has suffered deep and substantial cultural losses in the rush through socialism to modernity as well, with religion, festivals and local languages and dialects front and center. Third, China only really stepped up its efforts in Xinjiang right after the US made \"terrorism/national security\" the catch-all political excuse de riguer in the noughties, post 911. Fourth, the Islamic presence in Xinjiang literally corresponds to a complete cultural genocide against a range of multicultural (but predominantly Buddhist) kingdoms so effective that we are still piecing together how to read their (significant) literature today. Fifth, a $290M CCTV contract is nothing versus daily US military-industrial spending. Sixth, modern China's main push against peoples in this region began as early as the 1940s based on a joint China-Russia opposition to nomadic tribes in the region, documented in the book <i>Kazak Exodus</i>. <a href=\"http://pratyeka.org/books/kazak-exodus/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pratyeka.org/books/kazak-exodus/</a>"

        "The noodles and barbecue arrive within 30 minutes. The containers they come in could be around for hundreds of years thereafter.Credit...Lam Yik Fei for The New York TimesMay 28, 2019BEIJING In all likelihood, the enduring physical legacy of Chinas internet boom will not be the glass-and-steel office complexes or the fancy apartments for tech elites.It will be the plastic.The astronomical growth of food delivery apps in China is flooding the country with takeout containers, utensils and bags. And the countrys patchy recycling system isnt keeping up. The vast majority of this plastic ends up discarded, buried or burned with the rest of the trash, researchers and recyclers say. Scientists estimate that the online takeout business in China was responsible for 1.6 million tons of packaging waste in 2017, a ninefold jump from two years before. That includes 1.2 million tons of plastic containers, 175,000 tons of disposable chopsticks, 164,000 tons of plastic bags and 44,000 tons of plastic spoons. Put together, it is more than the amount of residential and commercial trash of all kinds disposed of each year by the city of Philadelphia. The total for 2018 grew to an estimated two million tons.ImageCredit...Na Zhou for The New York TimesHalf a days work for just a few pennies. It isnt worth it, said Ren Yong, 40, a garbage collector at a downtown Shanghai office building. He said he threw takeout containers out.For many overworked or merely lazy people in urban China, the leading takeout platforms Meituan and Ele.me are replacing cooking or eating out as the preferred means of obtaining nourishment. Delivery is so cheap, and the apps offer such generous discounts, that it is now possible to believe that ordering a single cup of coffee for delivery is a sane, reasonable thing to do.Yuan Ruqian knows that it is not. Yet she, too, has succumbed. Like the time she was craving ice cream, but a newly opened Dippin Dots store seemed so far away. Or when she orders delivery for lunch, which is nearly every day. Asked about the trash she generates, Ms. Yuan, 27, who works in finance in Shanghai, said: Laziness is the root of all evil. The transformation of daily life has been swift. Meituan says it delivered 6.4 billion food orders last year, a nearly 60 percent jump from 2017. Those orders were worth $42 billion in total, meaning the average order was $6.50 about enough for a decent meal for one in a big Chinese city.ImageCredit...Na Zhou for The New York TimesEle.me the name means Are you hungry? and is pronounced UH-luh-muh has not disclosed similar figures. But across Chinas major takeout apps, orders worth a combined $70 billion were delivered in 2018, according to the analysis firm iResearch.By comparison, online food delivery sales in the United States are expected to total $19 billion this year, according to Statista. Uber says its Uber Eats service generated $7.9 billion in orders worldwide last year. GrubHub reported $5.1 billion in food sales and 159 million orders in 2018, implying an average order value of $32.Around the world, the convenience of such services comes with costs that can be easy to overlook. Labor controversies, for instance. Or roads made more hazardous by takeout couriers zooming around on motorbikes. Plastic waste is just as easily ignored, even when it is being generated and mismanaged on a titanic scale.China is home to a quarter of all plastic waste that is dumped out in the open. Scientists estimate that the Yangtze River emptied 367,000 tons of plastic debris into the sea in 2015, more than any other river in the world, and twice the amount carried by the Ganges in India and Bangladesh. The worlds third and fourth most polluting rivers are also in China.Takeout apps may be indirectly encouraging restaurants to use more plastic. Restaurants in China that do business through Meituan and Ele.me say they are so dependent on customer ratings that they would rather use heavier containers, or sheathe an order in an extra layer of plastic wrap, than risk a bad review because of a spill.ImageCredit...Na Zhou for The New York TimesMeituan is deeply committed to reducing the environmental impact of food delivery, the company said in a statement, pointing to initiatives such as allowing users to choose not to receive disposable tableware. The e-commerce titan Alibaba, which owns Ele.me, declined to comment. This deluge of trash might not be such a big problem were China not in the middle of a monumental, if flawed, effort to fix its recycling system. Recycling has long been a gritty, unregulated affair in the country, one driven less by green virtue than by the business opportunity in extracting value out of other peoples leavings. The government now wants a recycling industry that doesnt spoil the environment or sicken workers. The transition hasnt been smooth.China recently banned many types of scrap from being imported into the country, hoping that recyclers would focus on processing domestic material instead. That killed off a lucrative business for those recyclers, and left American cities scrambling to find new dumping grounds for their cardboard and plastic. Some cities have been forced to end their recycling programs.ImageCredit...Na Zhou for The New York TimesOther policies may inadvertently be causing fewer recyclables to be collected from Chinas homes and offices. In Beijing, many scavengers who do this work have fallen victim to an aggressive government campaign to improve the quality of the citys population, a euphemism for driving out migrant workers from the countryside. To clean up the filthy air in Beijing, the government has also clamped down on small, scattered polluting enterprises in the capital region. Inspectors have since closed down hundreds of dingy backyard workshops that cleaned and processed plastic scrap.Not everyone mourns the loss. For years, Mao Da, an environmental researcher, has studied the plastic industry in Wenan County, near Beijing. Workers there used to sort through food and medical waste by hand, he said. Nonrecyclable material was buried in pits near farmland. It was an environmental and public health catastrophe, Mr. Mao said. So far, though, the crackdown hasnt caused large, professionally managed recycling companies to fill the void. Instead, it has left the entire business in limbo.Youve got fewer people collecting scrap, fewer people transporting it and fewer people processing it, said Chen Liwen, the founder of Zero-Waste Villages, a nonprofit that promotes recycling in rural China. The overall recycling rate has definitely fallen.ImageCredit...Na Zhou for The New York TimesIn Chifeng, a small city northeast of Beijing, Zhang Jialin is pondering life after recycling. For years, Mr. Zhang and his wife bought plastic scrap and ground it into chips. But the local authorities have stepped up environmental inspections. The city has slated Mr. Zhangs street for demolition. He and other recyclers believe it is because officials consider their scrapyards an eyesore. The Chifeng government didnt respond to a request for comment.What I do is environmental protection, Mr. Zhang, 45, said. I dont let stuff get thrown everywhere. I break it down. I wash it.He continued: So why do the environmental protection authorities target me as if I were harming environmental protection? Thats what I dont get. ",
        "In Chinese university cafeterias, you had to pay 1, 2, or 5 mao (I don’t remember the exact amount, this was 15 years ago, probably more now anyways) if you don’t bring your own food container to hold the food you get.<p>Perhaps permanent containers could be used for food delivery charges on a deposit basis (pay money for them, get it back when they are returned, perhaps sent back on a future delivery).",

        "Xinjiang Dispatch A surveillance state reaches new heights. April 4, 2019 Start We visited Kashgar several times to see what life is like. We couldnt interview residents that would have been too risky for them, because we were constantly followed by the police. But the restrictions were everywhere. Every 100 yards or so, the police stand at checkpoints with guns, shields and clubs. Many are Uighurs. The surveillance couldnt work without them. Muslim minorities line up, stone-faced, to swipe their official identity cards. At big checkpoints, they lift their chins while a machine takes their photos, and wait to be notified if they can go on. The police sometimes take Uighurs phones and check to make sure they have installed compulsory software that monitors calls and messages. Xinjiang is in Chinas far west, but it feels more part of central Asia. Ethnic minorities including Uighurs, Kazakhs and Tajiks outnumber the Han Chinese majority here. They are mostly Sunni Muslims with their own cultures and languages. Sometimes their choices made no sense. One erased this picture of a camel, though I was able to restore it. In China there are no whys, he said. For Uighurs, the surveillance is even more pervasive. Neighborhood monitors are assigned to watch over groups of families, as in this photo. An army of millions of police and official monitors can question Uighurs and search their homes. They grade residents for reliability. A low grade brings more visits, maybe detention. This is Dilnur. She fled Kashgar to Turkey three years ago and has lost touch with her family in Xinjiang. But she remembers the searches: They dont care if its morning or night, they would come in every time they want. Orphanages have been taking away the children of detainees. We dont know how many, but the government says that orphanages like this one held 7,000 children across Kashgar alone last year. Surveillance cameras are everywhere. In streets, doorways, shops, mosques. Look at this stretch of street. We counted 20 cameras. Chinese companies are earning a fortune selling this surveillance technology. They make it sound like a sci-fi miracle allowing the police to track people with laser precision. Demo at the World Internet Conference, 2017 But spend time in Xinjiang and you see that the surveillance state acts more like a sledgehammer sweeping, indiscriminate; as much about intimidation as monitoring. Demo at a trade show, 2017 At the mosque, worshipers register and go through a security check. Inside, they pray under surveillance cameras that the police can monitor. Children are interrogated. In the kindergarten, they would ask little children, Do your parents read the Quran? Dilnur told us. My daughter had a classmate who said, My mom teaches me the Quran. The next day, they are gone. The very architecture of Kashgar has been altered to make the city easier to control. The Old City, a maze-like area of mudbrick homes, has mostly been demolished. The government said it was for safety and sanitation. But the rebuilding has also created wider streets that are easier to monitor and patrol. Some areas are still undergoing demolition and reconstruction. The new brick homes seem more comfortable, but Uighurs mourn their old neighborhoods. Tourists wander the refurbished alleys, often unaware of the ancient lanes they replaced. But visitors are kept far from the indoctrination camps on the edge of town. This piece of land in southern Kashgar was empty in August 2016. Now this is a re-education camp with a capacity of roughly 20,000 people. The government says it is a vocational training center. A recent satellite image shows the camp occupies more than 195,000 square meters. This camp is not the only one growing. These 13 camps in Kashgar have all jumped in size, reaching 1 million square meters last year. Christopher Buckley, Paul Mozur and Austin Ramzy are foreign correspondents for The New York Times.

        "If a war broke out between the United States and China, the clash between two of the worlds most powerful militaries would be horrific. And the United States could very well lose.Thats a concern among current and former defense officials and military analysts, one of whom told Breaking Defense earlier this year that in war games simulating great-power conflict in which the United States fights Russia and China, the United States gets its ass handed to it.Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum last week, Admiral Philip Davidson, who oversees U.S. military forces in Asia, called China the greatest long-term strategic threat to the United States and the rules-based international order. He described Chinas rapid military buildup in nearly every domainair, sea, land, space, and cyberand said that while Chinas capabilities dont outnumber Americas in the region for now, its possible they could overtake the United States within the next five years.But the sheer number of ships, missiles, planes, and people doesnt tell the whole story. What already gives the Chinese the advantage is geography.The Obama administrations ill-fated Asia pivot did not prevent the growth of Chinas military and economic power in the region, as it built artificial islands, embedded itself in key infrastructure projects, and invested in its military. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has called into question whether the United States would defend its treaty allies in the Pacific, such as Japan, with complaints about the expense. (Davidson said at Aspen that there is no more important American ally in the world than Japan.)Read: Chinas great leap backwardThe question is what could actually cause the United States to fight China. What if China invades and occupies Taiwan, a democratic U.S. partner and arms customer? Would America actually risk World War III? What if China forces its claim to the Senkaku Islands, which the United States considers to belong to Japan? Does that fall within Americas treaty commitments to defend its ally?Theres no guarantee that a U.S. president, especially Trump, would resort to war in either case. But these are among the scenarios war-gamers at the Rand Corporation have studied to see if the United States could prevent China from claiming territory by force. Its not clear that the U.S. could.Notably, the likeliest U.S.-China war scenarios take place in Asiaits not that a Chinese victory means the Chinese Communist Party takes over Washington, but that the U.S. cant successfully eject China from Japanese-claimed territory or Taiwan. In an attempt to do so, besides cyberattacks, the United States could attack Chinese forces from the air or sea. The problem is that China has spent at least the past 20 years, partly informed by observations of how the U.S. conducted the Gulf War in the 1990s, preparing for exactly this kind of conflict, and investing in defenses that could violently thwart a U.S. approach.It has missiles that can sink ships. It has missiles that can down airplanes. And it has missiles that could theoretically reach U.S. regional bases in Japan and Guam, leaving planes and runways vulnerable to attack. Many Chinese observers suggest that missile strikes on air bases would be part of the opening salvos of a war, notes Rands U.S.-China Military Scorecard. Shutting down such a base even for a matter of days, according to Rand, could be enough to change the course of the conflict.Read: Trumps trade war with China is changing the worldThe Chinese dont have to comprehensively defeat the United States militarily in order to achieve their near-term objectives, David Ochmanek, a senior international and defense researcher at Rand, told me. If their objective is to overrun Taiwan, that in principle can be accomplished in a finite time period, measured in days to weeks.Ochmanek participated in the Rand war games that showed the U.S. losing. Its not just that theyll be attacking air bases in the region. Theyll be attacking aircraft carriers at sea, Ochmanek said. Theyll be attacking our sensors in space. Theyll be attacking our communications links that largely run through space. Theyll be corrupting the databases in our command systems. Theyre going to try to suppress us in every dimension that they can. They will try, but its also worth noting that many of these capabilities are untested and that, in contrast to the United States, China doesnt have a lot of experience actually using its weapons in combat.Yet the growth of Chinese capabilities represents a big change from about 20 years ago, when President Bill Clinton sent aircraft carriers near the Taiwan Strait to deter Chinese threats against the island. China at the time had been firing missiles toward Taiwan, but its missile arsenal was far less capable and precise. When that carrier was deployed by President Clinton, the Chinese couldnt even find it, Chris Brose, the former staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a separate talk at the Aspen forum. And theyve spent 25 years not only figuring out how to find systems like that, but how to overwhelm them with very large volumes of precision weapons.If the U.S. were to deploy an aircraft carrier near the strait when there was a real possibility of conflict, Brose said, lets put it this way, I wouldnt want to be on that aircraft carrier.Read: Trump is preparing for a new cold war with ChinaFor now, the United States is countering China in calibrated ways that send a message of displeasure but that are not likely to provoke an aggressive response from Beijing. The United States has stepped up its pace of sending Navy ships through the strait, as well as its freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea. France and Britain have also conducted such exercises. And the United States is competing with or confronting China outside of the military realm as well, slapping high tariffs on Chinese imports in pursuit of a trade deal and banning the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei from doing business in the U.S. Washington has, however, been less aggressive in pushing China on human-rights and democracy issues, including Chinas mass detention of Uighur Muslims and its support of a crackdown on protesters in Hong Kong.The United States knows a lot about Chinas capabilities, but discerning its intent is another question. John McLaughlin, a former acting director of the CIA who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University, notes that Chinese officials have said they aim to be a global power, but what that really means is not clear. Are they trying to build a defensive buffer zone around their borders? A lot of countries do that. Or is their intent something more sinister?When I look at the world, you can sort of say there are certain countries that are hostile to us clearly, such as North Korea and Iran, McLaughlin told me. China still represents a huge uncertainty.Nearly a decade ago, thenDefense Secretary Robert Gates warned about the dangers of a high end war, and said that any defense secretary who advised sending a land army into Asia (or the Middle East or Africa) should have his head examined. The likely costs of such a conflict have only risen since then, and so has the reluctance of the commander in chief to get involved in expensive foreign entanglements.As for the Democrats vying to replace Trump, many of the 2020 primary candidates have cited China as a major national-security threat, highlighting a bipartisan consensus on the issue in Washington. The policies that flow from that perception are still in most cases a work in progress, however.Theres another uncertainty: War games are one thing and reality is another. Intangibles such as training could affect the outcome.They havent fought many wars, McLaughlin said. So to some degree, their actual performance beyond war games is yet to be determined. And hopefully we wont have to determine it. ",
        "The US and Taiwan don't have military alliance.  The Taiwan Relations Act is carefully worded to avoid any commitment and maintain strategic ambiguity and keep both sides in check. The strategic interest of the US is limited in terms of the cost of defending Taiwan.<p>The article and many articles like it fail to explain the big picture. The US has indirect way to counter Chinese aggression. Sea blockade from distance where  the US has military advantage would cut almost all sea traffic to China and isolate it from the world economy. Chinese are well aware of their position as a logistic cul-de-sac.  The Belt and Road Initiative can be seen as long term strategic plan to go around this problem. It loses money but Chinese need it to work so they do it anyway.",
        "As an amateur military historian (specializing in WW2 in the Pacific), the salient things are:<p>- WW2 was a contest to the death of ideologies that happened after the USA became isolationist and weak (Dr. Hansen)<p>- today, the USA is not overtly isolationist, however their loyalty to Taiwan, HK, etc. is suspect. The USA is weak on aircraft inventory - the F-22 fleet rounds off to zero, same with the F-35. Way to go, military procurement officers!<p>- The CCP is brittle - they may go nuclear if facing a loss since they never back down or take no for an answer<p>- Taiwan could plan to defend itself. It already has enough F-16s (unless surprise-striked), it just needs to give every citizen a MANPAD and a rifle.<p>- Although CCP is building a navy to rival the USA, the USA is ready today and could blockade China and overwhlem the 9-dash islands with cruise missiles or ICBMs.<p>- the one advantage of a war with China is that the USA would have a free pass to rain missiles on North Korea<p>Interesting times!"

        "Americans are consuming more and more stuff. Now that other countries wont take our papers and plastics, theyre ending up in the trash. Plastic, paper, glass, and cardboard at a Recology facility in San Francisco(Robert Galbraith / Reuters)After decades of earnest public-information campaigns, Americans are finally recycling. Airports, malls, schools, and office buildings across the country have bins for plastic bottles and aluminum cans and newspapers. In some cities, you can be fined if inspectors discover that you havent recycled appropriately.But now much of that carefully sorted recycling is ending up in the trash.For decades, we were sending the bulk of our recycling to Chinatons and tons of it, sent over on ships to be made into goods such as shoes and bags and new plastic products. But last year, the country restricted imports of certain recyclables, including mixed papermagazines, office paper, junk mailand most plastics. Waste-management companies across the country are telling towns, cities, and counties that there is no longer a market for their recycling. These municipalities have two choices: pay much higher rates to get rid of recycling, or throw it all away.Most are choosing the latter. We are doing our best to be environmentally responsible, but we cant afford it, said Judie Milner, the city manager of Franklin, New Hampshire. Since 2010, Franklin has offered curbside recycling and encouraged residents to put paper, metal, and plastic in their green bins. When the program launched, Franklin could break even on recycling by selling it for $6 a ton. Now, Milner told me, the transfer station is charging the town $125 a ton to recycle, or $68 a ton to incinerate. One-fifth of Franklins residents live below the poverty line, and the city government didnt want to ask them to pay more to recycle, so all those carefully sorted bottles and cans are being burned. Milner hates knowing that Franklin is releasing toxins into the environment, but theres not much she can do. Plastic is just not one of the things we have a market for, she said.The same thing is happening across the country. Broadway, Virginia, had a recycling program for 22 years, but recently suspended it after Waste Management told the town that prices would increase by 63 percent, and then stopped offering recycling pickup as a service. It almost feels illegal, to throw plastic bottles away, the town manager, Kyle OBrien, told me.Without a market for mixed paper, bales of the stuff started to pile up in Blaine County, Idaho; the county eventually stopped collecting it and took the 35 bales it had hoped to recycle to a landfill. The town of Fort Edward, New York, suspended its recycling program in July and admitted it had actually been taking recycling to an incinerator for months. Determined to hold out until the market turns around, the nonprofit Keep Northern Illinois Beautiful has collected 400,000 tons of plastic. But for now, it is piling the bales behind the facility where it collects plastic.This end of recycling comes at a time when the United States is creating more waste than ever. In 2015, the most recent year for which national data are available, America generated 262.4 million tons of waste, up 4.5 percent from 2010 and 60 percent from 1985. That amounts to nearly five pounds per person a day. New York City collected 934 tons of metal, plastic, and glass a day from residents last year, a 33 percent increase from 2013.Read: We are all accumulating mountains of thingsFor a long time, Americans have had little incentive to consume less. Its inexpensive to buy products, and its even cheaper to throw them away at the end of their short lives. But the costs of all this garbage are growing, especially now that bottles and papers that were once recycled are now ending up in the trash.One of those costs is environmental: When organic waste sits in a landfill, it decomposes, emitting methane, which is bad for the climatelandfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions in the country. Burning plastic may create some energy, but it also produces carbon emissions. And while many incineration facilities bill themselves as waste to energy plants, studies have found that they release more harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, into the air per unit of energy than do coal plants.And as cities are now learning, the other cost is financial. The United States still has a fair amount of landfill space left, but its getting expensive to ship waste hundreds of miles to those landfills. Some dumps are raising costs to deal with all this extra waste; according to one estimate, along the West Coast, landfill fees increased by $8 a ton from 2017 to 2018. Some of these costs are already being passed on to consumers, but most haventyet.Americans are going to have to come to terms with a new reality: All those toothpaste tubes and shopping bags and water bottles that didnt exist 50 years ago need to go somewhere, and creating this much waste has a price we havent had to pay so far. Weve had an ostrich-in-the-sand approach to the entire system, said Jeremy OBrien, director of applied research at the Solid Waste Association of North America, a trade association. Were producing a lot of waste ourselves, and we should take care of it ourselves.As the trash piles up, American cities are scrambling to figure out what to do with everything they had previously sent to China. But few businesses want it domestically, for one very big reason: Despite all those advertising campaigns, Americans are terrible at recycling.About 25 percent of what ends up in the blue bins is contaminated, according to the National Waste & Recycling Association. For decades, weve been throwing just about whatever we wantedwire hangers and pizza boxes and ketchup bottles and yogurt containersinto the bin and sending it to China, where low-paid workers sorted through it and cleaned it up. Thats no longer an option. And in the United States, at least, it rarely makes sense to employ people to sort through our recycling so that it can be made into new material, because virgin plastics and paper are still cheaper in comparison.Even in San Francisco, often lauded for its environmentalism, waste-management companies struggle to keep recycling uncontaminated. I visited a state-of-the-art facility operated by San Franciscos recycling provider, Recology, where million-dollar machines separate aluminum from paper from plastic from garbage. But as the Recology spokesman Robert Reed walked me through the plant, he kept pointing out nonrecyclables gumming up the works. Workers wearing masks and helmets grabbed laundry baskets off a fast-moving conveyor belt of cardboard as some non-cardboard items escaped their gloved hands. Recology has to stop another machine twice a day so a technician can pry plastic bags from where theyve clogged up the gear.Bales of plastic are piled at a Recology facility in San Francisco. (Alana Semuels / The Atlantic)Cleaning up recycling means employing people to slowly go through materials, which is expensive. Jacob Greenberg, a commissioner in Blaine County, Idaho, told me that the countys mixed-paper recycling was about 90 percent clean. But its paper broker said the mixed paper needed to be 99 percent clean for anyone to buy it, and elected officials didnt want to hike fees to get there. At what point do you feel like youre spending more money than what it takes for people to feel good about recycling? he said.Then theres the challenge of educating people about what can and cant be recycled, even as the number of items they touch on a daily basis grows. Americans tend to be aspirational about their recycling, tossing an item in the blue bin because it makes them feel less guilty about consuming it and throwing it away. Even in San Francisco, Reed kept pointing out items that arent easily recyclable but that keep showing up at the Recology plant: soy-sauce packets and pizza boxes, candy-bar wrappers and dry-cleaner bags, the lids of to-go coffee cups and plastic take-out containers.If we can somehow figure out how to better sort recycling, some U.S. markets for plastics and paper may emerge. But selling it domestically will still be harder than it would be in a place such as China, where a booming manufacturing sector has constant demand for materials. The viability of recycling varies tremendously by locale; San Francisco can recycle its glass back into bottles in six weeks, according to Recology, while many other cities are finding that glass is so heavy and breaks so easily that it is nearly impossible to truck it to a place that will recycle it. Akron, Ohio, is just one of many cities that have ended glass recycling since the China policy changes.For now, its still often cheaper for companies to manufacture using new materials than recycled ones. Michael Rohwer, a director at Business for Social Responsibility, works with companies that try to be more environmentally friendly. He told me that recycled plastic costs pennies more than new plastic, and those pennies add up when youre manufacturing millions of items. Items made of different types of plastic nearly always end up in the trash, because recyclers cant separate the plastics from one anotherReed equates it with trying to get the sugar and eggs out of a cake after youve baked it. But because companies dont bear the costs of disposal, they have no incentive to manufacture products out of material that will be easier to recycle.The best way to fix recycling is probably persuading people to buy less stuff, which would also have the benefit of reducing some of the upstream waste created when products are made. But thats a hard sell in the United States, where consumer spending accounts for 68 percent of the GDP. The strong economy means more people have more spending money, too, and often the things they buy, such as new phones, and the places they shop, such as Amazon, are designed to sell them even more things. The average American spent 7 percent more on food and 8 percent more on personal-care products and services in 2017 than in 2016, according to government data.Read: The Amazon selling machineSome places are still trying to get people to buy less. The city of San Francisco, for instance, is trying to get residents to think of a fourth r beyond reduce, reuse, and recyclerefuse. It wants people to be smarter about what they purchase, avoiding plastic bottles and straws and other disposable goods. But its been tough in a place centered on acquiring the newest technology. This is our big challenge: How do you take a culture like San Francisco and get people excited about less? Debbie Raphael, the director of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, told me. The city passed an ordinance that required that 10 percent of beverages sold be available in reusable containers, and it is trying to make reuse hip through an online campaign and dedicated website, Raphael said. San Francisco and other Bay Area cities have banned plastic bags and plastic straws, but that option isnt available in many other parts of the country, where recently passed state laws prevent cities from banning products.But even in San Francisco, the most careful consumers still generate a lot of waste. Plastic clamshell containers are difficult to recycle because the material theyre made of is so flimsybut its hard to find berries not sold in those containers, even at most farmers markets. Go into a Best Buy or Target in San Francisco to buy headphones or a charger, and youll still end up with plastic packaging to throw away. Amazon has tried to reduce waste by sending products in white and blue plastic envelopes, but when I visited the Recology plant, they littered the floor because theyre very hard to recycle. Even at Recology, an employee-owned company that benefits when people recycle well, the hurdles to getting rid of plastics were evident. Reed chided me for eating my daily Chobani yogurt out of small, five-ounce containers rather than out of big, 32-ounce tubs, but I saw a five-ounce Yoplait container in a trash can of the control room of the Recology plant. While there, Reed handed me a pair of small orange earplugs meant to protect my ears from the noise of the plant. They were wrapped in a type of flimsy plastic that is nearly impossible to recycle. When I left the plant, I kept the earplugs and the plastic in my bag, not sure what to do with them. Eventually, I threw them in the trash.Related Videos ",
        "The garbage disposal problem, of which recycling is a subset, is due to a lack of back pressure in the consumption system.<p>From the perspective of production, disposal is an externality. From the perspective of the consumer, disposal is an annoyance that they typically don't have enough buyer power individually to push back on to producers.<p>Society has come up one workaround: social conscience, the green movement, so that shame can be used to attack brands, aggregating buying power to push back on producers. It doesn't work brilliantly with everyone - some people are allergic to the ritualistic, moralizing pseudo-religious aspects of the movement.<p>Politics has come up with another: WEEE: the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. This is an attempt to tax goods by incorporating the cost of disposal into the purchase price. While the green movement was necessary to provide political will, it's much better than a directly shaming approach - the closer the cost of disposal can be pushed to the producer, tightening the feedback loop, the more likely economic incentives will work.<p>Continuing to push the problem upstream into production is the long term answer. If you try and increase costs at point of disposal, consumers are simply incentivized to cheat, or pay people to cheat on their behalf. The whole exporting of rubbish to China wheeze was one big cheat. The costs have to be loaded at the point of purchase, and producers ultimately made responsible for costs of disposal.",
        "<i>If we can somehow figure out how to better sort recycling, some U.S. markets for plastics and paper may emerge.</i><p>The technology exists and is in production. Here's a new 90 ton per hour recycling plant, from Bulk Handling Systems, in California.[1] This is a good video to watch to see the whole process. Some of the separation is done with the usual air separators, vibrators, and screens. Optical sorters controlling air jets do some of the separation. This plant has no manual pickers; it uses AI vision controlled robots for the hard separation stations.  This is not a prototype; it's a big production plant.<p>Separating different plastics can be done with near infrared multispectral imaging. Here's a TOMRA sorter doing that in a real plant.[2] That's from 2015.<p>Finally, here's a big plant in LA which takes in plastic bottles and puts out clean plastic pellets ready for injection molding into new bottles.[3]<p>China is still accepting US plastics for recycling. It just has to be sorted down to 0.5% contamination, and that's being checked. The standard used to be 1.5%, it wasn't really enforced, and 5% contamination was not uncommon.  US recyclers have to upgrade their facilities to the point that there's no manual picking required on the output.<p>Big cities are dealing with this. Smaller communities have problems, because they don't have enough volume for the newer equipment and don't generate enough material to find buyers.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=254&v=4FpsH_ETT7c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=254&v=4FpsH_ETT7...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0OZ7Mlmkvk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0OZ7Mlmkvk</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-connected/carbonlite-inside-the-worlds-largest-plastic-bottle-recycling-plant-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-connected/carbonlite-inside...</a>\n[4] <a href=\"https://www.wastedive.com/news/china-contamination-standard-MRFs/519659/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.wastedive.com/news/china-contamination-standard-...</a>"

        "Google employees have carried out their own investigation into the companys plan to launch a censored search engine for China and say they are concerned that development of the project remains ongoing, The Intercept can reveal. Late last year, bosses moved engineers away from working on the controversial project, known as Dragonfly, and said that there were no current plans to launch it. However, a group of employees at the company was unsatisfied withthe lack of information from leadership on the issue and took matters into their own hands. The group has identified ongoing work on a batch of code that is associated with the China search engine, according to three Google sources. The development has stoked anger inside Google offices, where many of the companys 88,000 workforce previously protested against plans to launch the search engine, which was designed to censor broad categories of information associated with human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest. In December, The Intercept reported that an internal dispute and political pressure on Google had stopped development of Dragonfly. Google bosses had originally planned to launch it between January and April of this year. But they changed course after the outcry over the plan and indicated to employees who were working on the project that it was being shelved. Googles Caesar Sengupta, an executive with a leadership role on Dragonfly, told engineers and others who were working on the censored search engine in mid-December that they would be allocated new projects funded by different cost centers of the companys budget. In a message marked confidential do not forward, which has been newly obtained by The Intercept, Sengupta told the Dragonfly workers: Over the past few quarters, we have tackled different aspects of what search would look like in China. While weve made progress in our understanding of the market and user needs, many unknowns remain and currently we have no plans to launch. Back in July we said at our all hands that we did not feel we could make much progress right now. Since then, many people have effectively rolled off the project while others have been working on adjacent areas such as improving our Chinese language capabilities that also benefit users globally. Thank you for all of your hard work here. As we finalize business planning for 2019, our priority is for you to be productive and have clear objectives, so we have started to align cost centers to better reflect what people are actually working on. Thanks again and your leads will follow up with you on next steps. Sources with knowledge of Dragonfly said staff who were working on the project were not told to immediately cease their efforts. Rather, they were instructed to finish up the jobs they were doing and then they would be allocated new work on other teams. Some of those who were working on Dragonfly were moved into different areas, focusing on projects related to Googles search services in India, Indonesia, Russia, the Middle East, and Brazil.I just dont know where the leadership is coming from anymore.But Google executives, including CEO Sundar Pichai, refused both publicly and privately to completely rule out launching the censored search engine in the future.This led a group of concerned employees who were themselves not directly involved with Dragonfly to closely monitor the companys internal systems for information about the project and circulate their findings on an internal messaging list. The employees have been keeping tabs on repositories of code thatarestored on Googles computers, which they say is linked to Dragonfly. The code was created for two smartphone search apps named Maotai and Longfei that Google planned to roll out in China for users of Android and iOS mobile devices. The employees identified about 500 changes to the code in December, and more than 400 changes to the code between January and February of this year, which they believe indicates continued development of aspects of Dragonfly. (Since August 2017, the number of code changes has varied between about 150 to 500 each month, one source said.) The employees say there are still some 100 workers allocated to the cost center associated with Dragonfly, meaning that the company is maintaining a budget for potential ongoing work on the plan. Google sources with knowledge of Dragonfly said that the code changes could possibly be attributed to employees who have continued this year to wrap up aspects of the work they were doing to develop the Chinese search platform. I still believe the project is dead, but were still waiting for a declaration from Google that censorship is unacceptable and that they will not collaborate with governments in the oppression of their people, said one source familiar with Dragonfly. The lack of clarity from management has resulted in Google losing skilled engineers and developers. In recent months, several Google employees have resigned in part due to Dragonfly and leaderships handling of the project. The Intercept knows of six staff at the company, including two in senior positions, who have quit since December, and three others who are planning to follow them out the door. Colin McMillen, who worked as a software engineer at Google for nine years, quit the company in early February. He told The Intercept that he had been concerned about Dragonfly and other ethically dubious decisions, such as Googles multimillion-dollar severance packages for executives accused of sexual harassment.I think they are going to try it again in a year or two.Prior to leaving the company, McMillen said he and his colleagues had strong indications that something is still happening with Google search in China. But they were left confused about the status of the China plan because upper management would not discuss it. I just dont know where the leadership is coming from anymore, he said. They have really closed down communication and become significantly less transparent. In 2006, Google launched a censored search engine in China, but stopped operating the service in the country in 2010, taking a clear anti-censorship position. At the time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin declared that he wanted to show that the company was opposing censorship and speaking out for the freedom of political dissent. Pichai, Googles CEO since 2015, has taken a different position. He has a strong desire to launch search again in China viewing the censorship as a worthwhile trade-off to gain access to the countrys more than 800 million internet users and he may now be waiting for the controversy around Dragonfly to die down before quietly resurrecting the plan. Right now it feels unlaunchable, but I dont think they are canceling outright, McMillen said. I think they are putting it on the back burner and are going to try it again in a year or two with a different code name or approach. Anna Bacciarelli, a technology researcher at Amnesty International, called on Google to publicly confirm that it has dropped Dragonfly for good, not just for now. Bacciarelli told The Intercept that Amnestys Secretary General Kumi Naidoo had visited Googles Mountain View headquarters in California last week to reiterate concerns over Dragonfly and the apparent disregard for transparency and accountability around the project. If Google is still developing the censored search engine, Bacciarelli said, its not only failing on its human rights responsibilities but ignoring the hundreds of Google employees, more than 70 human rights organizations, and hundreds of thousands of campaign supporters around the world who have all called on the company to respect human rights and drop Dragonfly. Google did not respond to a request for comment. ",
        "I find kind of hypocrite to reject the idea of a company working in a product that serves the Chinese market (which, btw, is ultra protectionist), while actively consuming goods that are manufactured in China.<p>I'm not saying that people don't have the right to morally object something like this project, but it's kind of baffling that many are loudly voicing their concerns and demonizing any company that is attempting to do something in China, while looking the other way when tweeting from their Chinese made iPhones, and writing dissenting articles in their Chinese made computers.<p>People should try to find better ways to calibrate their moral compass and focus their activism into more important and threatening issues. There are liberties that are being violated right here, right now.<p>If you think you can't work at Google because they are building a product for China, it would be pretty hard to work for any company in America, given how everything in this country is piggybacked on Chinese made goods.",
        "Google execs know that as long as they have the best benefits in the industry and keep their workers cushy they'll also have complete control over them. This is because when you're at the top of the food chain, very few people are actually willing to put their money where their mouth is and take meaningful action. It's deliciously hypocritical to see Google workers here (and HN posters in general) lament Facebook workers for being morally corrupt when they continue to enable and find excuses for Google and are guilty of the same thing.<p>Google <i>will</i> move forward with expansion into China. Anyone who doesn't believe that is frankly naive. The further censorship of the Chinese populace will be 100% in the name of greed and profit. But why should Googlers care? After all, those free meals, pools, video game rooms, and gyms aren't going to pay for themselves."

        "In Ecuador, cameras capture footage to be examined by police and domestic intelligence. The surveillance systems origin: China.VideotranscripttranscriptChinese Cameras Come With Chinese TacticsIs Chinese-style surveillance becoming normalized? A Times investigation found the Chinese surveillance state is spreading past its borders.Recognize this guy? How about this one? Him? They all have something in common. They govern like autocrats. These leaders are rising in an age where technology can make their lives much easier. And leading the way is China. At home, theyre pouring billions into the most sophisticated censorship and surveillance apparatus the world has ever known. I spent nearly a decade here. And halfway through that period, something changed. Xi Jinping took power, and cameras started appearing a lot of them. Now, the cameras are everywhere. They hang from traffic lights, intersections, crosswalks; on trees, fences, and subway cars; even inside your taxi or your apartment building. These are, in fact, government surveillance cameras, and there are over 200 million of them here. The government says the cameras are used to fight crime, squash protests and maintain control. Its all designed to make sure the Communist Party of China never loses power. Basically, they want to know what their citizens are doing all the time, and their actions are being judged. Most of the time, its just police watching on the other end of these cameras. But the idea is that one day soon, artificial intelligence will be able to automate that job, analyzing the day-to-day lives of hundreds of millions of citizens. You might think, well, thats just China. But its not only in China. See that? That camera is in Ecuador. This is Ecuadors emergency response system, which is known as ECU-911. The government peddles it as a crime fighting tool. Ecuador has around 4,000 national security cameras across the entire country. The cameras all feed into a few centralized rooms, like this. The system was not only made in China, but it was installed by Chinese companies and workers. The Chinese even trained the Ecuadoreans how to use it. Reporter: Theyre telling the public that this is for safety. We went back, we can see what the surveillance looks like. So this is, what, 30 people in a room surveilling society. Wow. Reporter: Now my question, though, is: If you wanted to stop crime, would you have 30 people in a room? To me, that number, 30, does not seem like a lot of people. So 30 people, perhaps monitoring a nationwide camera system might seem little, but its the deterrent effect of the cameras which impact on people. Its them moderating their behavior based on the fact that they know that they might be being surveilled, and they dont know how that information might be being used. And thats the point. This might be able to fight crime. But just like in China, the cameras have potential for other use. Surveillance technology exporting this kind of surveillance capabilities to a country like Ecuador makes money. This is Edin, a global surveillance expert in the U.K. I asked him, so what has China actually exported here? Well it secures our diplomatic relationship with China, and it exports their model of internet governorship and how our security infrastructure is going to look like in the future. Chinese surveillance systems are increasingly showing up all around the world. Some of those countries have stronger government institutions to regulate than others, but they all need money to buy it. Turns out, the Chinese can help with that, too. We know it started at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Behind the scenes, China was selling its state-of-the-art security setup to visiting delegations. This is where Ecuadorian officials first saw it. So, China and Ecuador made a deal. This is Martha, a former politician turned investigative journalist. This all happened under the former president Rafael Correa, who was widely seen as an autocrat. He rewrote Ecuadors Constitution. He erased term limits. He took control of the courts and silenced the press. Helping him each step of the way was money from China. So, China got Ecuadors oil and Ecuador got things like roads and hospitals. It also got a nationwide surveillance system. And this is what it looks like today. Rafael Correa has been out of office for more than two years now, and Lenn Moreno has taken the country back in a more democratic direction. But even after autocrats leave office, their legacies can live on. After all, there is a system in place with a sinister potential. It just depends how its being used. Lidia lives in a high-crime neighborhood on the citys mountainside. She says the police rarely respond to crimes that happen directly in front of cameras and that some of the most dangerous neighborhoods, like hers, dont have any cameras at all. While Lidias neighborhood has none, theres unexpectedly one here, in a safe neighborhood. Its the only camera around, and it can see right into this mans house. Colonel Pazmino was a vocal critic of former president Rafael Correa, and he was often followed by government spies. He says when the Chinese camera system came in, the spies went home. In other words, Colonel Pazmino thinks the system is used for more than emergencies. He believes the states intelligence unit uses it to track political dissidents like him. In China, authorities have also installed cameras outside of dissidents homes. We brought this claim to Francisco Robayo, who was ECU-911s director at the time. He said, the system isnt for spying on or intimidating political opponents. He deflected, and so did the countrys intelligence chief. We were in a secret, unmarked bunker outside of the capital, and we were not allowed to point our camera at anything outside of this single frame. We came to ask Mr. Costa if the intelligence agency uses the public security cameras to spy on citizens. Midway through our interview, we took a break. Remember how we were only allowed to take this one single frame? Well, thats because they didnt want us filming the background thats deliberately out of focus right now. But when not looking through the lens of the camera, we could still see it clearly. Once we pointed out the feeds from ECU-911, they admitted they also could access the public security cameras. Ecuadors officials maintain the system is a crime-fighting tool. But why the system also feeds into the intelligence agency raises the same concerns that human rights advocates raise in China. These cameras are easier to abuse than use. It just depends what your goals are. And remember, Chinas goal is political control. Thats what these systems were designed for. In effect, China is exporting more than cameras. They are exporting the way they use their cameras. And while other countries also offer systems, including the U.S., many say China is thought to be the most dangerous because it provides funding, even to known dictators, and provides them with a sinister model for how to use it. Weve seen cases where governments around the world have used surveillance technology to infiltrate and spy on dissidents, on activists, on lawyers, on opposition parties. So this actually, fundamentally undermines democracy. More and more leaders like Rafael Correa appear to be rising. Now they have access to technology, undreamt of even 20 years ago. And China seems willing to give them cheap loans to buy it. The more countries that install Chinas centralized surveillance technology, the more that Chinas very own autocratic use of it may be normalized. And like in Ecuador, the infrastructure for autocracy stays even as leaders come and go. What the question for us now as people who are now more surveilled than ever, is how we want to live in this world, how we want to regulate that, and what kind of surveillance we want to be put under? [question asked in Spanish]Is Chinese-style surveillance becoming normalized? A Times investigation found the Chinese surveillance state is spreading past its borders.CreditCredit...Jonah M. Kessel/The New York TimesApril 24, 2019QUITO, Ecuador The squat gray building in Ecuadors capital commands a sweeping view of the citys sparkling sprawl, from the high-rises at the base of the Andean valley to the pastel neighborhoods that spill up its mountainsides.The police who work inside are looking elsewhere. They spend their days poring over computer screens, watching footage that comes in from 4,300 cameras across the country.The high-powered cameras send what they see to 16 monitoring centers in Ecuador that employ more than 3,000 people. Armed with joysticks, the police control the cameras and scan the streets for drug deals, muggings and murders. If they spy something, they zoom in.This voyeurs paradise is made with technology from what is fast becoming the global capital of surveillance: China.Ecuadors system, which was installed beginning in 2011, is a basic version of a program of computerized controls that Beijing has spent billions to build out over a decade of technological progress. According to Ecuadors government, these cameras feed footage to the police for manual review. But a New York Times investigation found that the footage also goes to the countrys feared domestic intelligence agency, which under the previous president, Rafael Correa, had a lengthy track record of following, intimidating and attacking political opponents. Even as a new administration under President Lenn Moreno investigates the agencys abuses, the group still gets the videos.Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has vastly expanded domestic surveillance, fueling a new generation of companies that make sophisticated technology at ever lower prices. A global infrastructure initiative is spreading that technology even further.Ecuador shows how technology built for Chinas political system is now being applied and sometimes abused by other governments. Today, 18 countries including Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates and Germany are using Chinese-made intelligent monitoring systems, and 36 have received training in topics like public opinion guidance, which is typically a euphemism for censorship, according to an October report from Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group.With Chinas surveillance know-how and equipment now flowing to the world, critics warn that it could help underpin a future of tech-driven authoritarianism, potentially leading to a loss of privacy on an industrial scale. Often described as public security systems, the technologies have darker potential uses as tools of political repression.Theyre selling this as the future of governance; the future will be all about controlling the masses through technology, Adrian Shahbaz, research director at Freedom House, said of Chinas new tech exports.Companies worldwide provide the components and code of dystopian digital surveillance and democratic nations like Britain and the United States also have ways of watching their citizens. But Chinas growing market dominance has changed things. Loans from Beijing have made surveillance technology available to governments that could not previously afford it, while Chinas authoritarian system has diminished the transparency and accountability of its use.For locals seeking to push back, there is little recourse. Chinese companies operate with less scrutiny and regard for corporate social responsibility than their Western counterparts. Activists in Ecuador say that while they have succeeded in working with civil society groups in Europe and America to oppose sales of surveillance technologies, similar campaigns in China have not been possible.We dont have the capacity to demand information from China its really difficult, said the former Ecuadorean legislator Martha Rolds.Ecuadors system, called ECU-911, was largely made by two Chinese companies, the state-controlled C.E.I.E.C. and Huawei.VideoReplicas of the network have been sold to Venezuela, Bolivia and Angola, according to government announcements and Chinese state media.C.E.I.E.C. and Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Huawei said: Huawei provides technology to support smart city and safe city programs across the world. In each case, Huawei does not get involved in setting public policy in terms of how that technology is used.In Ecuador, the cameras that are part of ECU-911 hang from poles and rooftops, from the Galpagos Islands to the Amazonian jungle. The system lets the authorities track phones and may soon get facial-recognition capabilities. Recordings allow the police to review and reconstruct past incidents.While ECU-911 was sold to the public as a way to get a grip on dizzying murder rates and drug-related petty crime, it also served Mr. Correas authoritarian streak, supporting his feared National Intelligence Secretariat, or Senain, according to a former head of the group. In a rare interview last year at Senains headquarters in a bunker outside Quito, its leader at the time, Jorge Costa, confirmed that the domestic intelligence group had access to a mirror of the Chinese-built surveillance system.The irony is that ECU-911 has not been effective at stopping crime, many Ecuadoreans said, though the systems installation paralleled a period of falling crime rates. Ecuadoreans cite muggings and attacks that happened in front of the cameras without police response. Still, the police have built public support, partly by releasing clips on Twitter and television of thieves and muggers caught on camera.Left to choose between privacy and safety, many Ecuadoreans opt for the unblinking gaze of the electronic eyes. With the mass surveillance genie out of the bottle, community leaders have called for cameras to help secure their neighborhoods, even when their own experiences are that the devices do not work well. Concerns about the long-term political implications trail behind the pressing realities of violence and drugs.Mr. Moreno, who came to power in 2017 and has walked back some of Mr. Correas autocratic policies, has vowed to investigate Senains abuses and is remaking the intelligence collection agency under a new name. His government helped open up ECU-911 and Senain to The Times.The government viewed espionage as a toolbox, and they could use any tool they wanted, Ms. Rolds said. They could spy on your emails, your phone calls, they would set microphones on your vehicle. At the same time, you had people following you. It was a whole system.Interested in All Things Tech?

At the time, Beijing was pulling footage from 300,000 cameras to keep tabs on 17 million people. The Ecuadoreans left impressed.For the Olympics, China developed emergency response centers which had state-of-the-art technology for its time, Francisco Robayo, then the general director of ECU-911, said in an interview last year. Our authorities saw these as ideal to bring to Ecuador.The timing was fortuitous. Mr. Correa was newly in power and facing high crime rates. In January 2011, he made surveillance a priority.Mr. Correas ministers turned to China. In two months, details to install a Chinese-made technology system were ironed out with the help of military attachs from the Chinese Embassy in Quito, according to a person familiar with the process and to publicly available documents from Ecuadors comptroller. Ecuadorean officials traveled again to Beijing to scope out the system, which featured technology made by the parent company of the state-backed C.E.I.E.C.By February 2011, with guarantees of state funding from the attachs, Ecuador signed a deal with no public bidding process. The country got a Chinese-designed surveillance system financed by Chinese loans. In exchange, Ecuador provided one of its main exports, oil. The money for the cameras and computing flowed straight to C.E.I.E.C. and Huawei.The money always ends up going back to China, Ms. Rolds said.It became a pattern. In exchange for credit facilities that totaled more than $19 billion, Ecuador signed away large portions of its oil reserves. A surge of Chinese-built infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric dams and refineries, followed.By comparison, ECU-911 was a small line item.With an initial sticker price of more than $200 million, construction started near Guayaquil, a booming coastal city where crime rates are high, Mr. Robayo said. Over the next four years, the system expanded across Ecuador.Cameras were hung anywhere that provided a good view. Operation centers were set up. Top Ecuadorean officials traveled to China for training, and Chinese engineers visited to teach their Ecuadorean counterparts how to work the system.The activity attracted attention from Ecuadors neighbors. Venezuelan officials came to see the system, according to a 2013 account from an Ecuadorean official working on the project. In an effort led by the onetime head of intelligence for Hugo Chvez, Venezuela then sprang for a larger version of the system, with a goal of adding 30,000 cameras. Bolivia followed.Beijings ambitions go much further than the abilities those countries bought. Today, the police across China gather material from tens of millions of cameras, and billions of records of travel, internet use and business activities, to keep tabs on citizens. The national watch list of would-be criminals and potential political agitators includes 20 million to 30 million people more than Ecuadors population of 16 million.Chinese start-ups, backed in part by American investment, are competing to build methods for automated policing. They create algorithms that look for suspicious patterns in social media use and computer-vision software to track minorities and petitioners across cities. The spending spree has driven down prices for all types of policing gadgets, as varied as identity-card checkers and high-resolution security cameras. In China, Ecuadors project received praise. State media held it up as an example of a new China exporting advanced technology, instead of providing low-cost labor to assemble it.In 2016, when President Xi visited Ecuador, he stopped by ECU-911 headquarters. Mr. Robayo said Mr. Xi had shown up for about five minutes, enough time for photo opportunities. The snapshots went up on C.E.I.E.C.s website, a sign of official support from the most powerful Chinese leader in a generation. A ZOOM WITH A VIEW VideoTo the government of Mr. Correa, Mario Pazmio was a known man.A retired Ecuadorean Army colonel who adopted stray dogs more than a dozen to keep himself busy in the twilight of his career, Mr. Pazmio kept up another pet hobby: criticizing the government of Mr. Correa.He complained about police corruption. He argued that Mr. Correas government was complicit in Ecuadors growing drug trade. He called out what he perceived as the administrations incompetence.Mr. Pazmios efforts earned him his own retinue of secret police. They set up in an apartment across from his house, and followed him when he went out.Just as Mr. Chvez had done in Venezuela, Mr. Correa tightened the reins in Ecuador. He eliminated presidential term limits, intimidated and ejected judges, and sent henchmen to follow and attack political opponents and activists, like Mr. Pazmio and Ms. Rolds.His government also turned to ECU-911. I think few people know about it or are actually aware of the huge power of ECU-911, Ms. Rolds said. There are few people who really know the extent of the tracking. She added that Senain used just about any technology it could get its hands on to harass and follow Mr. Correas political opponents.A seasoned intelligence officer, Mr. Pazmio, 59, said even he was surprised when, in 2013, a video camera that was part of ECU-911 was installed directly outside his house. It hung from a pole on a traffic divider in the middle of the street, with a full view through a window into his second-story apartment.There is a direct collaboration between ECU-911, the Intelligence Secretariat and also those who surveil and persecute political or social actors, said Mr. Pazmio, citing his own experience, as well as documents and people who had worked in Senain.Mr. Pazmio said that after the camera went in, surveillance teams following him backed off. The camera otherwise made no real sense where it was. Mr. Pazmio lives in a relatively safe neighborhood, and no other ECU-911 cameras were installed nearby. It was a move out of the police playbook in China, where cameras are positioned outside the doors of high-profile activists.A visit to Senains headquarters confirmed Mr. Pazmios suspicion. On a wall of screens that served as a sort of agency control room, Times reporters recognized footage from the ECU-911 system.Mr. Costa, who was in charge of the transition between Senain and its successor, acknowledged the transmissions but said he was not responsible for how they had been used in Mr. Correas administration.Mr. Pazmio said he had an idea of who should be held accountable: China. He said the country had supported and emboldened Mr. Correa, just as it had leaders in neighboring Venezuela. As conditions deteriorated in Venezuela last year, Huawei engineers helped train Venezuelan engineers on how to maintain their version of Ecuadors system.I believe what the Chinese model generates is control over society, he said. A rigid control.THE LIMITS OF SURVEILLANCEVideoEl Tejar has some of the best views in Quito and some of its worst crime.As Lidia Rueda, a community organizer, walked the steep, winding streets of this neighborhood, where she has lived for 30 years, she pointed down the hill to where the bodies of several murdered women were found. Drug dealers come and go with impunity, she said. Muggings are common. Thieves break streetlights to get the cover of darkness.The crime has not subsided even though ECU-911 cameras arrived at the base of the hill several years ago. Ms. Rueda gestured to a pedestrian bridge there, where one man had grabbed her and threatened her with a knife while another had taken her money. The 2014 mugging happened directly beneath a police camera. No help came.Ms. Ruedas experience encapsulates the complex relationship many Ecuadoreans have with the cameras. While the authorities said the cameras had reduced crime, anecdotes of its dysfunction abound.Where there are cameras, they often dont work, said Ms. Rueda, 61. Another possibility was simply that no one was watching.The odds are against Ecuadors police force. Quito has more than 800 cameras. But during a Times visit, 30 police officers were on duty to check the footage. In their gray building atop the hill, officers spend a few minutes looking at footage from one camera and then switch. Preventing crime is only part of the job. In a control room, dispatchers supported responses to emergency calls.Most of the time, no one was on the other side of the lens.It was a reminder that the system, and others like it, are more easily used for snooping than crime prevention. Following someone on the streets requires a small team, while large numbers of well-coordinated police are necessary to stop crime.Mr. Robayo argued that ECU-911 had been responsible for a major drop in murders and an almost 13 percent drop in crime in 2018 from the previous year. The mere existence of a camera can also have a profound effect, he said.Many Ecuadoreans agree. Despite Ms. Ruedas mugging, she has called for the installation of more cameras in El Tejar. The best way to fix the neighborhoods crime problems is to fix the surveillance system, she said.The police have told her that the cameras are too expensive for her neighborhood. To that, Ms. Rueda took a fatalistic view.It is always the same problem, a budget shortage, she said. Only when someone is killed, then the authorities come and say, Now were going to do it.Arturo Torres Ramrez contributed reporting.Melissa Chan is a reporter focused on transnational issues, often involving Chinas influence beyond its borders.

Too large: also no privacy.<p>In the first case, for example a roving band of stone-agers, say N = 30 with all males related and everybody knowing the leader.

The censorship of China seems to be attractive because of the endless hateful noise of social media, the orderliness of having criminals removed from society permanently via the death penalty suddenly seems attractive. The lesser-educated never really cared for abstract notions of liberty anyway. In short, the authoritarian surveillance state is an increasingly attractive proposition to large swathes of humanity."

        "In 2009, after internet-fueled race riots between Uighur Muslims and Han Chinese in Chinas northwest territory of Xinjiang, the ruling Communist Party took drastic action: the digital kill switch. Beijing disabled Xinjiangs internet, sending military police to restore order. The blackout lasted nearly a year. Now, a decade later, Xinjiang is writhing under a new clampdown aimed at the Uighurs. This time, Beijing has embraced the opposite philosophy: a digital panopticon, enlisting private tech firms to expand Chinas internet of things and enmesh its own people. The technologies being honed in Xinjiang, driven by this kind of illiberal innovation, may be coming soon to an app store near you. These exports risk enabling aspiring autocrats worldwide, and may concentrate alarming power in the hands of Chinas Communist Party. Until recently, China was dismissed as an innovation laggard that copied technology from the West. Today, many Chinese tech sectors have leapfrogged Silicon Valley, sometimes with heavy-handed help from the party. Consumer-friendly smartphone apps have pushed cash, credit cards and identification documents toward extinction. Hotel booking systems will ping your smartphone, linked to your national ID card, to let you check in using facial recognition. In under a minute, a mom-and-pop hardware kiosk can create a personalized QR code for cashless payments through WeChat, an indispensable app that combines the functions of WhatsApp, Venmo, Seamless, Uber and more. For an expatriate accustomed to Chinas freewheeling start-up scene and whizzy tech conveniences, coming home can feel like stepping back in time. But, as the Uighur minority of Xinjiang are learning, that convenience comes at an Orwellian price. Speedy data networks and integrated digital commerce are learning to work with the partys aggressive security apparatus. Invasive DNA databases and facial recognition powered by artificial intelligence have created a digital dragnet, enhanced by mandatory surveillance apps installed on smartphones and backed by a newly built network of IRL gulags. Offenses as trivial as forwarding a traditional Islamic holiday greeting on WeChat, or posting a bearded selfie, can land citizens in internment camps. Even Uighurs living abroad are entangled, through their families and their smartphones, in Beijings crackdown. (The repression has reportedly created a black market in old Nokia phones, which are less legible to the state.) Xinjiangs plight is more than a local tragedy: It is a warning. An ethnic Uighur woman walks in front of a giant screen with a picture of Chinese President Xi Jinping in the main city square in Kashgar in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China. The screen broadcasts a slideshow of images of Xi on loop, including propaganda images of his previous visit to Xinjiang. Thomas Peter for Reuters The global risk from Chinas technology sector is not necessarily a sinister conspiracy to exert Xinjiang-style controls overseas. Beijings leaders are focused on domestic affairs and for now, Chinas budding tech dystopia is still more Brazil than Black Mirror. Rather, this risk is a byproduct of Beijings business as usual, on a huge global scale. Products created for Chinas vast surveilled and censored domestic market are increasingly popular overseas, where they are often cheaper and more appealing to consumers. Huawei, for instance, has honed its 5G wireless technology which will support the next generation of data-intensive, A.I.-powered gadgets in Chinas domestic, bleeding-edge consumer market for the internet of things. Many Huawei phones are bought by Chinese who have never owned a PC or other digital device, giving the company an edge in imagining and designing mobile products for developing markets that skipped over the PC era. Huaweis cheaper (and often subsidized) price points, and comparable or superior products, have made its phones a better-value purchase than the iPhone for cost-savvy consumers around the world, and its 5G infrastructure attractive for penny-pinching governments. Most are unaware, or apparently unconcerned, about censorship or surveillance. They should be worried. According to the Soviet-style playbook that still influences Chinese security services, collecting haystacks of citizen information, by whatever means necessary, is the foundation of social control and stability maintenance. The Soviet model was an analog blend of Big Brother and big data, amassing reams of information about citizens to understand their fears, vulnerabilities and intentions, and pre-empt any challenge to the Party-States power. China has adapted this paranoid style to the modern tech age. Private corporations and the Communist Partys security apparatus have grown together, discovering how the same data sets can both cater to consumers and help commissars calibrate repression. The partys instinctual contempt for privacy, married to its proactive industrial policy, can be a boon for well-connected private businesses. Many tech firms make a point of hiring the relatives of high party officials, and a vast state database of headshots might be shared with a private firm to train new facial recognition software, while the firms trove of real-time user data might be offered to police, for a panoramic view of potential troublemakers. Between the Communist Partys repressive impulses, its influence over Chinas vast and innovative tech ecosystem, and new technologys general propensity to disrupt and surprise, it is nave to expect that we can fully anticipate and mitigate the impact of illiberal innovations exported abroad. Even innocuous-seeming technology, when paired with Chinas authoritarian impulses and state-led development model, may challenge liberal values in unexpected ways. Consider TikTok, a social video-sharing app that last year had more downloads on the Apple app store than Instagram. TikTok fills a market niche abandoned by Vine, the American-grown short-video-sharing app shuttered by Twitter in 2017. Users can upload videos of themselves or friends lip-synching the latest pop tunes or decorating or distorting their faces, all easily edited into a clip for other users to like, share or comment on. To Chinas surveillance state, a video-sharing app offers much more than than your dog dancing to Drake. TikToks domestic Chinese version, Douyin, is heavily censored and surveilled: Last year, the British cartoon Peppa Pig was purged from the platform after the authorities decided she had taken on subversive meaning. (It is unclear whether this was because of a direct government order or the company pre-emptively censoring itself.) For residents of Xinjiang, posting a video of traditional Uighur music sung in their native language might be flagged by machine-learning algorithms, and bring a deletion and a visit from the police. In what appear to be precautionary performances of loyalty to the government, Uighur users of Douyin have recorded themselves singing pro-party songs, pointedly in Mandarin. Given the wide use of facial recognition across Xinjiang, and the potential sharing of security data sets between state agencies and private firms, Douyins raw video data may also offer a tempting training set for machine-learning software. (Recent leaks have shown Chinas developing capability to match GPS coordinates with Uighur facial recognition data; with help from a Yale professor and an American biotech firm, Thermo Fisher, China has also built a database of Uighur DNA.) A video posted on Douyin of Uighur workers in Hotan singing Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China. The video, shared across Twitter and Facebook by the Uighur diaspora, was deleted from media platforms within China. A Douyin video, reportedly taken in Xinjiang, appears to show a Uighur child singing Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China. The user's Douyin ID and children's faces have been obscured to protect their identity. To date, no evidence suggests that Chinese authorities have used their leverage over Douyin domestically to censor or surveil TikTok overseas. But given what we know about Beijings illiberal impulses, there is a gap between what is provable beforehand, and what it is prudent to presume. The brazen lying that is normalized in Chinas corporate and political culture, and the meaninglessness of written rules, mean that published regulations, or guarantees by private firms and government officials, are simply not credible. (Just ask Prof. Kenneth Kidd, the geneticist at Yale who accepted assurances from his Chinese counterparts that DNA samples for their joint project would be ethically obtained. Dr. Kidd claimed to be shocked shocked to discover that the Ministry of Public Securitys sweet nothings cant be taken at face value. His credulous negligence has tainted a Yale DNA database; future generations may remember Thermo Fischer among corporate collaborationists like I.B.M. and Bayer.) TikTok itself has already been fined by the Federal Trade Commission for a casual attitude toward privacy compliance; its heavy-handed solution, mass deletions, enraged some consumers. But the choices of ByteDance, TikToks parent company, are rational; it fears the Communist Party more than angry tweets from tweens outside the Great Firewall. The Wests increasing technological and economic exposure to China may have unintended consequences. Over a decade ago, the singer Bjrk was banned from China, and muzzled within the Great Firewall, for advocating Tibetan independence during a concert in Shanghai. If, tomorrow, Bjrk followed up with a TikTok video pleading for Uighur rights, and the clip went viral globally, would the party be able to resist the temptation to lean on ByteDance to slow or stop it? If your face appears in the background of another persons TikTok video shot in Berlin, will it be logged using facial recognition software running in Shanghai? Those who complain that American firms like Facebook are invasive and unaccountable are unlikely to prefer Chinas tech giants, which are often cowed by, and collaborating with, the Party-States opaque and irascible censorship and surveillance apparatus.

Sign up for Charlie Warzels limited-run newsletter to explore whats at stake and what you can do about it.] To be sure, the United States has abused its own technological hegemony for power and profit. After World War II, much global communications infrastructure ran through wires on United States soil, giving American spies privileged access to the worlds communications. American intelligence agencies have been credibly accused of seeding United States-made electronic exports with bugs and spyware. American Apps Dominate in the Five Eyes Countries Each flag represents the country of origin of a top ten downloaded app within a national market. TikTok was the only Chinese app to become popular last year within the countries of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Source: Monthly data from App Annie The critical difference with China lies not in the wiring of chips or lines of code, but in history, culture and scale. By custom, Americans trust that the contents of their snail-mail letters are protected by the Fourth Amendment; government access requires a judge to issue a warrant. American tech firms routinely stand up to the United States government. Apple, for example, has developed default iOS encryptions that shield user activity from the company itself, to the frustration of the F.B.I. An iPhone user in Iran or Belarus benefits from Silicon Valleys civil libertarianism. China is different. The Peoples Republic has always reserved the right to open its citizens mail at any time, for any reason; there is no basis to believe its basic approach will differ because the technology is new. Ironically, the internet, which Western techno-utopians prophesied would liberalize China, may instead allow the party to indulge previously impossible fantasies of mass control. The Uighurs of Xinjiang are the first in human history to fully experience the downside of Chinas illiberal innovation. They are unlikely to be the last.

        "Not to get too \"whatabouty\" here, but it always feels a bit less poignant to call China out for the same things the United States, and massive private US corporations, are doing. Censorship, collection of private data, public data, biometrics, DNA, monitoring and incarcerating ethnic minorities. At least in China they have public healthcare.",
        "It's hard for me to read this in a US newspaper and square it with the real world.  It bemoans race riots and military police in Xinjiang - in China.  From the context of the Baltimore race riots three years ago I cast my mind to Xinjiang Muslim radicals <i>within</i> China - right next to the Afghans who American troops and military police patrol 18 years and counting, on the other side of the world.  Radicals in Afghanistan who the US  had originally armed in the 1970s and 1980s to overthrow the then secular Afghan government incidentally.<p>Then from Facebook Google and most of the surveillance San Francisco establishment, in lockstep with government PRISM, we look East to see the Chinese doing the same?<p>Africans in the US, native Americans at the Standing Rock reservation being water cannoned, are no better off than those in Xinjiang.  More African men in the US are in the prison system than college.<p>The demonization of China by Americans for what Americans are doing, with less reason, is silly.<p>It is like the hypocrisy of telling Venezuelan military to revolt and cheering street protests in Venezuela, then going back to hearings about Russian interference in the US or condemnations of yellow vest protests.  Macron praises the destructive protests in Caracas and condemns yellow vests in Paris in the same press conference."

        "The men jumped Stanley Ho without warning, smashing both his hands with metal rods -- one of multiple recent attacks against prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy figures that activists have dubbed a \"white terror\".Since late August, eight well-known pro-democracy figures have been beaten by unknown assailants as fear swirls that some \"triad\" crime networks have flocked to Beijing's cause after five months of protests.The victims include rally organisers, opposition lawmakers, student leaders and people standing for upcoming polls.Ho, a 35-year-old labour unionist, was set upon in late September by at least three people in Sai Kung, a rural district where he is competing in local elections against a pro-Beijing camp that has dominated the area for decades.\"The cause of the attack may be related to two things -- the upcoming district council election and the ongoing movement,\" Ho told AFP, referring to the protests.\"Some powerful people are creating 'white terror' in collaboration with criminals to make you fear standing for election and to make voters think twice before they express their opinions,\" he added, one arm still in a cast.The term \"white terror\" has been used to describe multiple periods of political persecution throughout history, but in Hong Kong it is borrowed from nearby Taiwan.During four decades of martial law there, organised crime groups frequently attacked critics of then-leader Chiang Kai-shek's repressive government.- No solution in sight -Vigilante violence has mounted on both sides of the ideological divide in Hong Kong as months of protests have spiralled with no political solution in sight.In recent weeks, crowds of pro-democracy supporters have savagely beaten people who vocally disagree with them -- although those fights tend to be spontaneous outbursts of mob anger during protests.Pro-democracy figures, however, have been attacked in a noticeably more targeted way.Last week, Jimmy Sham, the leader of a group that organised the largest rallies this summer, was left in a pool of blood after he was attacked by men wielding hammers. It was the second time he had been assaulted.Five victims of attacks have reported assaults to the police, but only three men have so far been arrested -- for the initial assault on Sham.Isaac Cheng, a 19-year-old student and vice chairman of the pro-democracy Demosisto party, was beaten by three men in early September outside his family home after he helped organise a school strike.\"I am confident in the police's capability to solve the case, but I am not confident in them actually doing it given the severity of selective law enforcement,\" Cheng said.Hong Kong's police have denied allegations of bias, saying they pursue all crimes regardless of political motivation.- Reputation hammered -But the force's reputation was hammered in late July after officers took nearly 40 minutes to respond to an attack by a group of men on pro-democracy protesters at Yuen Long train station.Officers were filmed allowing men armed with sticks to leave the area in the hours afterwards.Police have arrested 34 people for that attack, some with links to triad crime groups, and deny accusations they allowed the Yuen Long assault to happen.Haunted by fear and a shortage of trust in the police, pro-democracy figures say they now arrange their own protection, although their options are limited.\"All I can do is be more careful and recruit more volunteers so I don't have to work a street booth alone,\" said Janelle Leung, 25, a local election candidate who was attacked while campaigning.Davin Wong, a former leader of the University of Hong Kong's student union, moved abroad after he was attacked.But most victims refuse to be cowed.\"I do worry such attacks will be more frequent and serious,\" said Roy Kwong, a pro-democracy lawmaker who was attacked last month by a gang of men, one of whom filmed the beating.\"One important way to overcome fear is to continue our normal life and show those in the shadows that we are not intimidated.\" ",
        "Usually \"white terror\" is supposed to mean anti-communist violence. Red terror is the old name for communists killing or maiming running-dog(+) capitalists.<p>(+) What is the difference between a capitalist and a running-dog capitalist? I was never clear on that.",
