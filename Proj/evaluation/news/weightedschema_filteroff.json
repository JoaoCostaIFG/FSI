        "A majority of stuff, don't buy \"disposable\". As in, buy things of high quality, typically from other countries. While lots of people claim that's harsher on your finances. It's not in the long run.<p>The following story is my mental model for long term savings when I first moved out and realized how to help to save money. When my parents moved to America 30+ years ago, they bought a pretty pricey hand can opener from Germany for around $15 (1980s money). They still own it. To this day. I have a USA one that cost me like $20 about ten or so years ago. Still own it. I have friends who buy a new $1-$5 chinese one from Walmart every year because they keep breaking or dull out to uselessness. While that might seem silly/frugal. If you're replacing stuff constantly, you're dumping lots of potential spending money. I apply the same mentality with everything I buy. Buy quality so you buy it once. Not cheap shit every year. Be aware of what you buy. The more aware you are, the less you actually end up needing to buy.<p>Tech is a hard one. But is still doable. I'm looking at most of the brands around me right now, it's all either Korean or Japanese. Some parts are from China. Even if the brand is Korean or Japanese, they still do a lot of manufacturing with China. But oh well. It's the nature of the global economy. Same with a good amount of computer parts. You'll have a bunch of the commodity parts and pieces for boards made in China, then other stuff in other countries, with assembly in the USA or elsewhere. Sometimes it's Taiwan though, which is a separate nation.<p>You gotta do legwork and research on your own. Not everything is made in China that's available in the USA. I find it weird that people think they can't avoid chinese products. I never actually \"avoided\" Chinese made anything. I just happen to avoid it because I go for mid-tier products so I never have to rebuy most of my stuff. Like, I eat sardines a lot. Go to that section in walmart or any other grocery store. You'll find China, Poland, Canada, USA and German sourced sardines. All side by side."

        "Can China Refactor Western IT?",
        "If current trade disputes cut off China from Western tech, then China may be free to pursue IT standards and designs for internal use that are only partially interoperable with Western IT. Further, China may need designs that more efficiently use domestic chips and do not require as advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. One way to achieve these goals may be to \"refactor\" Western IT.<p>The design of current Western IT is governed by a plethora of standards, both official standards from IETF, IEEE, ITU, ISO..., as well as unofficial standards set by dominant manufacturers and associations.<p>The complexity of standards grew over 4 decades because researchers want their contributions included, manufacturers want their patent positions protected, incumbents want their investments protected, and new entrants want extensions for differentiation. The complexity of unofficial standards grows because of multiple competitors in the same market, avoidance of patents, and backward compatibility to protect market positions. Besides the variety of standard venues, there  is the inevitable commercial, political and interpersonal relationship issues that are settled by adopting compromises.<p>China, with less IT history and a large market, may be in a good position to analyse and extract a small subset of Western IT standards for internal adoption.<p>The West has coped with complexity by making very fast processors using advanced processes and implementing the complexity in software. With less complexity it may be possible to move more functionality into ASICs made by less advanced processes and achieve the same end user services results using less infrastructure and energy.<p>China may have an opportuntity to remove the cruft of compromise and the baggage of backward compatibility, and to refactor Western IT into a better system.",

        "This article will be difficult to read and was difficult to write. I hope that you can stomach the uncomfortable nature of this topic and read my thoughts in earnest. I usually focus on technology-related content, but at the end of the day, this is my personal blog and I feel that it would betray my personal principles to remain silent. Ive made an effort to provide citations for all of my assertions. Note: if you are interested in conducting an independent review of the factuality of the claims expressed in this article, please contact me. The keyboard Im typing these words into bears Made in China on the bottom. The same is true of the monitor Im using to edit the article. Its not true of all of my electronics the graphics processing unit which is driving the monitor was made in Taiwan1 and my phone was made in Vietnam.2 Regardless, theres no doubt that my life would be, to some degree, worse off if not for trade with China. Despite this, I am prepared to accept the consequences of severing economic relations with China. How bad would being cut-off from Chinas economy be? Were a net importer from China, and by over 4 times the volume.3 Lets assume, in the worst case, trade ties were completely severed. The United States would be unable to buy $155B worth of electronics, which we already have domestic manufacturing capabilities for4 and which have a productive life of several years. We could definitely stand to get used to repairing and reusing these instead of throwing them out. Wed lose $34B in mattresses and furniture same story. The bulk of our imports from China are luxury goods that we can already make here at home5 its just cheaper to buy them from China. But cheaper for whom? This gets at the heart of the reason why were tied to China economically. Its economically productive for the 1% to maintain a trade relationship with China. The financial incentives dont help any Americans, and in fact, most of us are hurt by this relationship.6 Trade is what keeps us shackled to the Chinese Communist Party government, but its not beneficial to anyone but those who are already obscenely rich, and certainly not for our poorest who, going into 2020, are as likely to be high school dropouts as they are to be doctors.7 So, we can cut off China. Why should we? Lets lay out the facts: China is conducting human rights violations on the largest scale the world has seen since Nazi Germany. China executes political prisoners8 and harvests their organs for transplant to sick elites on an industrial scale, targeting and killing civilians based on not only political, but also ethnic and religious factors. This is commonly known as genocide. China denies using the organs of prisoners, but theres credible doubt9 from the scientific community. Recent evidence directly connecting executions to organ harvesting is somewhat unreliable, but I dont think China deserves the benefit of the doubt. China is a world leader in executions, and is believed to conduct more executions than the rest of the world combined.10 Wait times for organ transplantation are extraordinarily low in China,11 on the order of weeks in most of the developed world these timeframes are measured in terms of years,12 and China has been unable to explain the source for tens of thousands of transplants in the past13. And, looking past recent evidence, China directly admitted to using the organs of executed prisoners in 2005.14 These atrocities are being committed against cultural minorities to further Chinas power. The UN published a statement in August 2018 stating that they have credible reports of over a million ethnic Uighurs being held in internment camps in Xinjiang,15 imprisoned with various other ethnic minorities from the region. Leaks in November 2019 reported by the New York Times showed that China admits the imprisoned have committed no crimes other than dissent,16 and that the camps were to be run with, quote, absolutely no mercy. Its nice to believe that we would have stood up to Nazi Germany if we had been there in the 1940s. China is our generations chance to prove ourselves of that conviction. We talk a big game about fighting against white nationalists in our own country, and pride ourselves on standing up against fascists. Its time we turned attention to the real fascists, on the world stage. Instead, the staunch capitalism of America, and the West as a whole, has swooped in to leverage Chinese fascism for a profit. Marriott Hotels apologized for listing Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan as countries separate from China.17 Apple removed the Taiwanese flag from iOS in China and the territories it claims.18 Activision/Blizzard banned several players for making pro-Hong Kong statements in tournaments and online.19 These behaviors make me ashamed to be an American. Fuck that. A brief history lesson: Hong Kong was originally controlled by the United Kingdom at the end of the Opium Wars. Its beyond the scope of this article, but itll suffice to say that the United Kingdom was brutal and out of line, and the end result is that Hong Kong became a British colony. Because of this, it was protected from direct Chinese influence during Chinas turbulent years following, and they were insulated from the effects of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which together claimed tens of millions of lives and secured the Communist Party of Chinas power into the present. On July 1st, 1997, the Sino-British Joint Declaration went into effect, and Hong Kong was turned over to China. The agreement stipulated that Hong Kong would remain effectively autonomous and self-governing for a period of 50 years until 2047. China has been gradually and illegally eroding that autonomy ever since. Today, Hong Kong citizens have effectively no representation in their government. The Legislative Council of Hong Kong has been deliberately engineered by China to be pro-Beijing a majority of the council is selected through processes with an inherent pro-Beijing bias, giving Hong Kong effectively no autonomous power to pass laws.20 Hong Kongs executive branch is even worse. The Chief Executive of Hong Kong (Carrie Lam) is elected by a committee of 1,200 members largely controlled by pro-Beijing seats, from a pool of pro-Beijing candidates, and the people have effectively no representation in the election. The office has been held by pro-Beijing politicians since it was established.21 The ongoing protests in Hong Kong were sparked by a mainland attempt to rein in Hong Kongs judicial system in a similar manner, with the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019,22 which would have allowed the authorities to extradite suspects awaiting trial to mainland China. These protests inspired the Hong Kong people to stand up against all of the injustices they have faced from Chinas illegal encroachments on their politics. The protesters have five demands:23 Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill No prosecution of the protesters Retraction of the characterization of the protests as riots Establish an independent inquiry into police misconduct Resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage Their first demand has been met, but the others are equally important and the protests show no signs of slowing. Unfortunately, China shows no signs of slowing their crackdown either, and have been consistently escalating the matter. The police are now threatening to use live rounds on the protesters,24 and people are already being shot in the streets.25 China is going to kill the protesters, [again][tiananmen]. The third demand the retraction of the characterization of the demonstrations as riots and the governments refusal to meet it, conveys a lot about Chinas true intentions. Chinese law defines rioting as a capital offense,26 and weve already demonstrated their willingness to execute political prisoners on a massive scale. These protesters are going to be killed if their demands arent met.27 Hong Kong is the place where humanity makes its stand against oppressors. The people of Hong Kong have been constant allies to the West, and their liberty is at stake. If we want others to stand up for us when our liberties are on the line, then its our turn to pay it forward now. The founding document of the United States of America28 describes the rights theyre defending as unalienable endowed upon all people by their Creator. The people of Hong Kong are our friends and were watching them get killed for rights that we hold dear in our own nations founding principles. We have a legal basis for demanding these rights for Hong Kongs people China is blatantly violating their autonomy, which they agreed to uphold in 1984. The United Kingdom should feel obligated to step in, but theyll need the support of the international community, which we need to be prepared to give them. We need to make an ultimatum: if China uses deadly force in Hong Kong, the international community will respond in kind. China isnt the only perpetrator of genocide today, but they are persecuting our friends. China has the second highest GDP29 in the world, and somehow this makes it okay. If we wont stand up to them, then who will? I call for a worldwide boycott of Chinese products, and of companies who kowtow to their demands or accept investment from China. I call for international condemnation of the Communist Party of Chinas behavior and premise for governance. And I call for an ultimatum to protect our allies from slaughter.

A political prisoner is someone who is imprisoned for political reasons, rather than legal reasons. In the eyes of Chinese law, there may be a legal standing for the imprisonment of some of these people, but because this is often based on dissent from the single political party, I consider these prisoners political as well.

        "Xi's in a trap. The nationalist fervor that the CCP has whipped up for decades, coupled with the demonization of the HK protestors by Chinese media and Xi's 'no compromise' stance, makes it impossible for him to lighten up -- and the protests to de-escalate -- without him seeming weak. The HK protestors/population at this point are so angry and the radical wing so large, that they won't willingly de-escalate. Even if Lam leaves the demonstrations will continue.

It doesn’t end.<p>- I find the general quality of things to be lower. Buildings are poor quality generally. Side walks aren’t as maintained. A lot of things look nice from a distance only.<p>- internet obviously. Things are blocked and vpn can be flaky.<p>- many every day things will be more difficult. Banking, medical care etc. On the other hand many things are also much more convenient. Food delivery, transportation (unless you want to drive yourself) etc<p>There are pros too of course. You get to learn about a different culture and language. You’ll be relatively wealthy compared to most people there. It’s really easy to meet new people.<p>In the end I’d say move there if there is a good reason: Higher salary, better opportunity you wouldn’t normally have or if you just want a change / adventure AND you can live with the cons, at least for a while."

        "A column on things Internet Other Formats: IPv6 in China December 2018 Much has been written about the progress of the adoption of IPv6 over the years. I know Ive been guilty of adding my writings into the pool, and this article is a further contribution to that pool of observations and measurements. In this case I want to look in some detail at the deployment of IPv6 in China. Why is China so important in this story of IPv6 deployment? We can look at IPv6 adoption in economic terms as a market. What we have is an unregulated market, in that market participants will act according to their perceptions of self-interest, as there is no external control over behaviours. The entrance of new goods and services into a market face some particular problems. If a good (a behaviour, a characteristic or a service) is used by only a small proportion of the markets consumers then either the good provides relative advantage to early adopters (the so-called early adopter advantage), in which case the volume of the market traded good will rise over time as other market participants are motivated to also realize this potential relative advantage, or it provides insufficient relative advantage, in which case the good will languish and possibly even disappear from this theoretical market. Once a good achieves a certain level of adoption a different market behaviour emerges. Late adopters suffer a penalty because they are not participating in this common activity and may well have to expend resources to compensate for their inability to directly participate in this market for the introduced product or service. The market has achieved critical mass, and at this point the pressures for adoption across the remainder of the market is virtually assured, as laggards in adoption are now at a relative disadvantage as compared to the pool of existing adopters. Its hard to tell at what point a critical mass condition might emerge, as the historical record shows different thresholds for the adoption of different goods and services. It may be as low as 5%, particularly if the early adopter advantage is very large, or it may be as high as 50% or 60% if there is virtually no early adopter advantage. Nicholas Felton of the New York Times reported on the adoption of a number of household items over the twentieth century (Figure 1). With the exception of the hiatus of consumer spending in the 1940s due to the war effort, adoption curves show a similar pattern, with a slow initial phase, an accelerated adoption phase and a declining market saturation phase. In retrospect the critical mass for colour televisions in the consumer market was just 5% of the consumer population, while the washing machine has experienced a much slower adoption momentum, and its critical mass appears to have been at 30%. Figure 1 - Adoption of household technologies in the US over the Twentieth Century, Nicholas Felton, New York Times IPv6 Adoption Worldwide If we look at the metrics of IPv6 adoption in human terms (by that I mean counting users rather than counting connected devices or the volume of traffic) then we observe that the five most populous economies are China, India, the United States of America, Indonesia and Brazil, and collectively these five economies contain some 48% of the worlds population. When we look at the population of Internet users per economy then there are some changes, in that countries with a high count of children and a low GDP per capital may not have as high a level of Internet use per capita as compared to richer and demographically more mature populations. The five largest Internet user economies are China, India, the United States of America, Brazil and Japan, and collectively they contain some 51% of the population of Internet users. Without knowing exactly what critical mass might be for the adoption of IPv6, it is certainly the case that if five largest national populations all adopted IPv6 then the assertion that IPv6 has achieved critical mass would be very hard to challenge. Of these five national economies, India has the highest IPv6 deployment counts. Some 60% of its estimated 475 million users are using devices and services that support IPv6 to the endpoint. The count in the United States of America is slightly lower at some 48% of its 291 million users. Brazil has an IPv6 infrastructure that serves 26% of its 140 million users, and Japan is measured at 30% of its 116 million users. China is the lowest of these five economies in terms of IPv6 deployment. China has an estimated Internet user population of 741 million, out of a total population of 1.4 billion people. If there was extensive deployment of IPv6 services in China, then the case that IPv6 has already achieved critical mass of deployment would be easy to make. On the other hand, if such a significant user population had no IPv6 service and no visible plans for IPv6 services, then the entire conversation about the times and certainties about the future of IPv6 takes on a different direction. Which means that China matters in the world of IPv6. It matters a lot. It is therefore no surprise that measuring IPv6 adoption in China is a topic of intense interest at present. Which is what I want to look at in this article. IP Adoption in China Internet measurement is always challenging. The Internet is largely constructed on a platform of private investment and network measurements can often be analysed to yield competitive market intelligence. The result is that broad based measurements that would allow us to gain real insight into the constituent networks behaviours are frustratingly scant. Of course, its not just researchers who get frustrated with this situation. Industry regulation and public policy relies not only on a solid understanding of the current environment but a sufficient amount of data to perform reasonable forecasts, but perhaps that's another article for another time. Lets look for some public data on IPv6 deployment in China. IPv6 Addresses in China The regional address registries maintain records on IP address allocations. In these records they also use a country designation, adding a two-letter country code to the address allocation record. This country designation does not necessarily designate where one may find hosts using these addresses on the Internet. That's not its purpose. The country code is generally used as the country where the major corporate office of the address holder is located, so its more of an administrative designation than a form of geolocation. There are some instances where a service provider spans multiple national economies and where allocated addresses may be found in any or all of these realms. There are also cases where the corporate address is in a different economy to where the addresses are actually deployed. However, these cases are not the majority of cases in the data, so while the data is not entirely reflective of actual geolocation, there is a strong correlation between the designed country code of an address allocation record and its actual geolocation of the advertised address. Figure 2 - IPv6 Address Allocations and BGP Advertisements in China 2010-2018 The day-by-day record of both the total volume of IPv6 addresses allocated or assigned to Chinese entities is shown in Figure 2. The overall bulk of IPv6 addresses allocated to Chinese entities were allocated in the period 2011 to 2015. More recently, a /21 was allocated in late 2017 (to CBN, China Broadcasting Network Corporation), and a /20 in 2918 (to SINOPEC, the China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation). While much of the advanced provisioning occurred some years ago, the total volume of IPv6 address prefixes advertised into the Internet inter-domain routing space has been very quiet until the end of 2017. On the 29th December 2017 the total advertised volume jumped from the equivalent of slightly less than a IPv6 /24 to a /20. In late October 2018 this volume of advertised addresses more than doubled, to slightly more than a /18 of address space. At the end of 2018 slightly under one half of the IPv6 allocated address space is now visible in the IPv6 routing tables. This is consistent with IPv6 deployment activity gathering some momentum in 2018, although precisely how to interpret these numbers if challenging. Advertising an IPv6 address prefix is a necessary precursor to deploying IPv6 services, but there may be a considerable time lag between addresses appearing in the routing system and addresses being used by services and end users. Figure 3 IPv4 Address Allocations and BGP Advertisements in China 2010-2018 Lets compare this against the comparable record of the allocation and advertisement of IPv4 addresses in China (Figure 3). APNIC, the regional internet address registry that serves China recorded a significant level of address allocations in the three months preceding the exhaustion of the general use address pool in April 2011, with some 130 million IPv4 addresses being allocated to China entities in this period. The advertisement of these addresses into the routing system took some further time. At the start of 2010 some 85% of allocated IPv4 addresses were visible in the routing system. This dropped to 75% at the point of address exhaustion in May 2010. However, in the ensuring seven years this number has climbed to the current level of 90% of allocated addresses that are visible in the routing system. The unadvertised IPv4 address pool in China covers some 32 million addresses in total, although this number is slowly declining. The rise in the address holdings in China since 2014 is due to address trading, where there is a net influx of IPv4 addresses into China. The comparable figure for IPv6 advertised addresses compared to the total allocated address pool is 49%, but this is not necessarily a comparison of similar items. IPv6 is not designed to be as intensively populated with connected host systems, as one of the rationales to head to a massively larger address space in IPv6 was to reduce, or even eliminate completely, the operators costs that are associated with achieving a very high address utilisation factor. Among other goals, IPv6 was intended to support a far lower, and cheaper, address utilisation ratio, so this 49% number as compared to 90% in IPv4 is consistent with this design objective. In IPv4 growth of addresses in China has essentially ground to a halt since 2016. Any expansion in the size of the IPv4 Internet in China has to be achieved with address sharing using various forms of Network Address Translation (NATs). Unfortunately, there is no public data on the level of NAT use in China or anywhere else for that matter, but the population numbers speak for themselves. Some 301 million IPv4 addresses serve some 741 million users. Some users may well have multiple connected devices, while others may share a single connected device, but it would not be unreasonable to estimate that the device population in China exceeds 1 billion devices, which means that the average IPv4 sharing ratio is around 3 devices per public IPv4 address. While the China IPv4 network ceased any major expansion in early 2016, when the last of the large IPv4 address blocks was deployed into the network, there has been a lag in the deployment of IPv6 into these networks. As is evident in Figure 2, IPv6 deployment activity in China stepped up only in early 2018, and the major expansion of the IPv6 network in terms of advertised addresses occurred in October 2018. It would be useful to complement this picture of IPv6 deployment in China from Internet Registry data with data gathered from public networks. Who is publishing measurements of use of IPv6 in China? Facebook Measurements Facebook publish a set of measurements on IPv6 adoption. The measurement is a measure of traffic volume seen by Facebook servers, and presumably counts the proportion of traffic that is passed over IPv6 as a proportion of the total traffic volumes served from Facebook servers. Facebook report both a total volume, which is some 25% of Facebooks total traffic as of the end of December 2018, and per country volumes. The data for IPv6 is available from the Adoption by Country reports at Facebook. The plot of the IPv6 data for 2018 is shown in Figure 4. There are a few points of comment about this data. The first comment is that the China IPv6 traffic proportion, rising from a low of 0.5% in mid-2018 to 2.5% at the end of the year, is still very low. A likely explanation may well be in the second comment, namely that Facebook is not normally accessible from within China (see this presentation of an account on one such experience). It is possible that Facebook users in China might be using some form of VPN tool, and also likely that the VPN tools that are being used are IPv4-only. It is curious that for the first couple of months in early 2018 the IPv6 traffic proportion dropped by 2/3, and remained at relatively low levels until August 2018, when it rose significantly to reach 2.5% by the end of the year. The sudden changes noted in May, and again in July, are more likely to occur when using a small data set, so its reasonable to guess that the underlying traffic volumes that lie behind this report are relatively small. Figure 4 Facebook report of proportion of IPv6 in Facebook traffic to China for 2018 In any case, as Facebook is reportedly not generally available within China, its likely that this measurement of 2.4% of traffic being IPv6 is not necessarily reflective of the broader picture of IP infrastructure within China. Google Measurements Google have a similar measurement page. Google reports that their numbers report on the percentage of users that access Google over IPv6. The total Internet-wide user proportion, as measured by Google, is that some 22% of weekday users access Google using IPv6, while the weekend numbers rise to 26%. Without a clear understanding of the exact composition of the user populations that are measured in this way it is still reasonable to conclude that consumer services have a higher level of use of IPv6 than the corporate and enterprise service world. Google report the current level of IPv6 use per country, and at the end of December Google reported some 3.37% of users in China used IPv6 to access Google (Figure 5). Figure 5 Google report of IPv6 in China While Google only publish daily reports, a useful time series of these daily measurements has been assembled by Eric Vyncke and a plot of this data is shown in Figure 6. It is not clear how popular Google is in China, particularly given that Google has formally withdrawn from the Chinese market. As with the Facebook data there are some unexpected rapid changes in the reported data, such as the rise and then collapse in early 2016 and then the rapid rise in early 2017. The pattern of the data in 2018 is consistent with that reported by Facebook, with a drop in the first part of the year and then a rise in the latter party, but while in the Facebook data we see the rise to be greater than the level at the start of the year, the Google data reports a 3.3% level at the end of the year, lower than the 4.2% level in the early part of the year. It is entirely possible that the Google data reflects only a small set of Chinese users, and, like the Facebook data, this may not be reflective of the larger picture of Chinese IPv6 deployment. Figure 6 Time series of Googles reports of IPv6 in China (data assembled by Eric Vynke) Akamai Measurements Akamai provide content distribution services to many online service providers, and they operate points of presence in many countries. Akamai publish a State of the Internet report that includes a measurement of their calculation of the proportion of Chinese users that use IPv6 to access Akamai services. They report an IPv6 rate of 4.6% as of the end of 2018 (Figure 7) Figure 7 Akamai report of IPv6 in China As with the Google data, a time series of these daily measurements has been assembled by Eric Vyncke and a plot of this data is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 Time series of Akamais reports of IPv6 in China (data assembled by Eric Vynke) This data has some level of correlation with the IPv6 advertised address time series in Figure 2. However, in this case there is a very pronounced change across 2018, with the end of year data measuring IPv6 use in China at 4.5%. The overall consistency of the data in the preceding years points to the likely use of a larger measurement population than Google and Facebook, which makes the pronounced spike of 8% in mid-2018 all the more curious. Akamai are not the only network reporting this anomaly. Cloudflare reported a similar spike in IPv6 use from AS9898 (China Mobile Guandong) at around the same time, so this spike may reflect some form of short-term test of IPv6 in one or more Chinese networks. APNIC Measurements APNIC has been performing measurements of IPv6 adoption using a measurement script embedded in an online advertisement campaign. When the ad is delivered to the browser an embedded script is activated. This script directs the browser to perform a fetch of a dual stack URL, an IPv4-only URL and an IPv6-only URL, all served by a common server operated by APNIC (this server is located in Singapore for Chinese users). The server is then able to report on the IPv6 capability of the users that run this measurement script. We use the server data to measure the number of Chinese users who can retrieve the IPv6 URL. The time series of the daily totals is shown in Figure 9. The current level of IPv6 in China has been recorded at some 7% in this data set. Figure 9 Time series of APNIC measurements of IPv6 in China The overall shape of the data is similar to that of Akamais data, namely a relatively small measurement of around 1% until mid-2018. There was a sharp spike in the data in July 2018, and then a pronounced increase in the level of IPv6 commencing in October 2018, currently sitting at some 7% of users. Figure 10 Ad impression count of APNIC measurements of IPv6 in China Ad campaign management has a large number of variable factors, as ad placement is influenced by other concurrent ad campaigns as well as the popularity of the apps that embed online ads. The result is that the daily volumes of ad presentations has considerable levels of variation, and Figure 10 shows the daily ad impression count of placements in China superimposed upon the IPv6 measurement. The measurement count of ads placed with Chinese end points was increased in late 2015 and has varied between one hundred thousand to over one million ad impressions per day since then. The measurement server for this measurement test is located in Singapore. The question has been asked as to whether the data would different if the data collection point was located within China. Is there a larger pool of IPv6 users within China that are unable to make IPv6 connections to points outside of China? To answer this question, weve been assisted with a data collection point located within China and performed the same URL tests to a server located inside China. This has allowed us to collect a view of IPv6 within China from a vantage point within China and a view from outside China. The results of this comparison are shown in Figure 11. Figure 11 Comparison of Domestic and External views of IPv6 in China The differences in the two views at the end of October and again across November and December appear to be related to server overload factors at the Singapore location, which caused a disproportionate drop in IPv4 URL requests from Singapore. This condition was addressed in mod-December and the IPv6 measurement is consistent at both server locations. It is also interesting that both servers in this campaign report an IPv6 measurement of close to 10% in the last week of December, some 2 3% greater than that seen from the larger worldwide ad campaign. Internally China has organised its ISPs along different lines to many other economies. Rather than each ISP enterprise using a single network with a single Autonomous System identifier, many Chinese ISPs have further divided the administrative view of their networks into regional networks. This is particularly so for China Unicom and China Mobile. If we look at China through the lens of Autonomous Systems, and view each of these regional networks as a network in its own right then there are 32 networks with an estimated customer base of 1 million users or more, and a further 26 networks with an estimated base on between 100,000 and 1 million users (the full table of estimates of users per network is reported here). One of these networks has been supporting IPv6 for many years, namely the China Education and Research Network (CERNET), AS 4538. With some variation, potentially due to variations in the measurement environment as much as variations in the network itself, the IPv6 use rate of that network has been around 30% for many years (Figure 12). Figure 12 IPv6 in AS4538 - CERNET In most of the other cases where we are looking at the IPv6 efforts of various public ISPs the deployment of IPv6 has occurred in recent months, which is an observation that is consistent with the address measurements and consistent with the Akamai data. Notably, many regional networks within the China Mobile group have been undertaking IPv6 deployment. A good example is the network that Cloudflare observed in July 2018, AS9808. Guandong Mobile. In this network large scale IPv6 deployment appeared to start with trials in September and October 2018 and then a larger deployment exercise took place across November 2018. By the end of 2018 the IPv6 deployment level in this network is some 15% (Figure 13). The spike on the 5th December is a measurement artefact, and not related to any activity by this network. Figure 13 IPv6 in AS9808 China Mobile Guandong A similar picture is evident with AS56048, China Mobile Beijing, with IPv6 trials in June, July and August, followed by large scale deployment taking place in November 2018. This networks current deployment level encompasses some 25% of their estimated user base of some 12 million customers (Figure 14). Again the zero points in November and December are measurement artefacts and not related to any changes in this network. Figure 14 IPv6 in AS56048 China Mobile Beijing Another member of the China Mobile group with a similar picture of very recent deployment of IPv6 is AS56047, China Mobile Huanan (Figure 15). Figure 15 IPv6 in AS56047 China Mobile Huanan And finally, what about Chinas largest ISP? Im referring to the Chinanet Backbone network, AS4134. This network is the largest network in China in terms of customers, with an estimated base of 300 million users. There is some visible movement with IPv6 deployment in this network, again commencing in November 2018. It should be noted that even at just 5% of their user base this network has deployed IPv6 services across 15 million customers, which is a commendable achievement (Figure 15). Figure 16 IPv6 in AS4134 ChinaNet Backbone Performance Quality of the IPv6 Service in China The APNIC measurement system permit two further measurements, namely connection failure and a comparison of IPv4 vs IPv6 round trip times. The connection loss is calculated by looking at the TCP three-way handshake that occurs between the client system and the server when opening up an HTTP session to retrieve the URL. TCP commences with the client sending the server a TCP packet with the SYN flag set. The server responds with a packet with the SYN and ACK flags set, and the client completes the connection by sending a TCP packet with the ACK flag set. A failed connection is defined as one where the server receives the initial TCP SYN packet, and sends the SYN/ACK response, but it never receives the final ACK. The most likely reason for these failed connectionsis local firewalls and filters. It is common for firewalls to permit all forms of outbound packets but examine and filter incoming packets. If the filters were configured on the basis of an IPv4-only service then incoming IPv6 packets, including these SYN/ACK responses will be dropped by such a firewall. Such a firewall configuration will always fail a IPv6 connection attempt. Figure 17 IPv6 connection failure rate for China The average IPv6 connection failure rate for the Internet is some 1%, so even the most recent value of 3% seen for IPv6 in China is well above this global average. Averages hide the variations visible in each network, and some Chinese networks are reporting very high IPv6 failure rates. The highest is AS 134543, China Unicom Guandong, which is reporting connection failure rate of up to 60% of attempted IPv6 connections. The largest network, AS4134, Chinanet Backbone, with a 15 million strong base of IPv6 clients is reporting a 4% loss rate. That's a staggering 600,000 users who are experiencing dropped IPv6 connections. This is a significant failure rate. The other measurement is comparing the connection round-trip time between IPv4 and IPv6 when we measure a dual-stack endpoint (Figure 18) Figure 18 RTT comparison between IPv6 and IPv4 for China If a user has a dual stack connected device the measurement script will get the user to retrieve a web object using IPv4 and again using IPv6 from the same physical server. By looking at the TCP handshakes in these two protocols we then have 2 round-trip time measurements between the same two endpoints, using IPv4 and IPv6. As seen by the APNIC server in Singapore, IPv6 connections take an average of some 70ms longer to connect to the server as compared to the IPv4 connection from the same endpoint. This points to asymmetric routing, where IPv6 routes are not handled identically to IPv4 routes, and in particular the path to Singapore appears, might take an extended path across the Pacific Ocean and back to reach Singapore, which the equivalent IPv4 path appears to be a direct north-south connection for most ISPs. This is not the case for all ISPs, and the mean standard deviation of the sample points is some 80ms. This means that different networks use different external routing configurations and this means that some networks show a better RTT performance between China and Singapore over IPv6 as compared to IPv4. AS5837, China Unicom Backbone, reports an IPv6 RTT to Singapore which is 25ms faster than the IPv4 RTT. What happens to these numbers when we look at connections that are terminated by a server located within China? Figure 19 shows the connection failure rate for this server. Figure 19 IPv6 Connection Failure rate for China domestic IPv6 service Unexpectedly, the connection failure rate is higher in this situation, and some 8% of IPv6 connection attempts to the domestic server are incomplete. There is no ready explanation for this higher connection failure rate. The internal IPv6 routing in China appears to be well managed, and the average difference in round trip times shows that that IPv4 and IPv6 appear to be handled in much the same manner (Figure 20). Figure 20 RTT comparison between IPv6 and IPv4 for China for Domestic services The high level of day to day variation in this average figure points to some level of fluctuation in these measurements, due perhaps in part to routing variations and in part to the variation in distributions of ad placement from day to day. We can look at by splitting out these measurements by network (Figure 21). Figure 21 RTT comparison between IPv6 and IPv4 for China for Domestic services, per AS There are three networks that appear to be using some long external path to reach a Chinese domestic server over IPv6. In many other cases IPv6 appears to offer slightly better RTT performance. Conclusion In the last couple of months, we have seen evidence that points to large scale deployment of IPv6 services in China. This is most evident in the regional networks of China Mobile and in ChinaNet. The IPv6 data published by Google and Facebook appears to see only a small part of the Chinese IP infrastructure and that may well be clouded by the use of VPNs to access these services. The picture from Akamai is consistent with what we are seeing with the APNIC ad-based measurement program. There has been a large-scale shift in China with IPv6 and starting in November there are very visible signs of movement in a number of these very large service networks. If one was to look to China to be the last piece in a critical mass of IPv6 deployment that will propel the Internets migration over the coming years, then the picture is looking very encouraging. Thanks I would like to acknowledge with gratitude the generous assistance of the good folk at CERNET in assisting with the domestic server part of this measurement project, and also acknowledge and thank Google for their continuing generous support of the APNIC measurement program.

        "Moral of the story- if you don't have local (government, sure, but also populace) support, it doesn't matter how big you are- TaoBao, AliExpress, etc. are China-first, locally built platforms that already had a foothold <i>before</i> Amazon showed up.<p>Also, business models- in my experience, Ali, and especially TaoBao are really open to drop-shipping and the like, which means that they don't need quite as many warehouses as Amazon.",

        "Amazon will close its domestic e-commerce marketplace business in China, effective from July 18. The company will keep running other business sections in China, including Amazon Web Services, Kindle e-books, and cross-border operations. The exit marked an end of the companys 15 years of journey into the China market for their rigid localization in business strategy and management. SEE ALSO: Amazon to Exit China This Week We are notifying sellers we will no longer operate a marketplace on Amazon.cn (the Chinese-language site) and we will no longer be providing seller services on Amazon.cn effective July 18, the company said in a statement as Financial Times reported. Amazons pulling out from China market didnt shock me that much, although it being an e-commerce giant in the domestic U.S. market is an undeniable fact. When I was in the U.S., Amazon was my first choice for shopping online because it had numerous trustworthy products. But its limited choice of brands and slow delivery (even with Prime membership) always bothered me, especially in comparison to the fast and abundant e-commerce services in China. Slow actions are costly for Amazon. Amazon has been developing gently in China, after it acquired Joyo.com, a Chinese online shopping website in 2004. We are very pleased to be entering the Chinese market with Joyo.com, said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. In a relatively short time, Joyo.com has established itself as the leading online destination for books, music and videos in China, and were happy to be part of one of the worlds most dynamic markets. Through this win-win acquisition, Amazon.com was supposed blend Joyo.coms expertise in serving the Chinese market with Amazon.coms experience as one of the worlds leading online retailers. However, it took Amazon three years to turn Joyo.com into Joyo Amazon, and another four years into Amazon.cn or Amazon China. What were local e-commerce companies in China doing during those seven years? Also in 2004, JD.coms retail platform went online. In 2008, Alibaba started the Singles Day shopping festival. Ten years later, customers from 230 countries and regions spent a total of $30.8 billion on online shopping on that single day. Huge discounts, fancy online advertisements and pervasive offline promotions from local rivals have been catching the eyes and wallets of Chinese consumers, while Amazon is pushing forwards in its old ways gentle and slow. Like its predecessors, such as Yahoo, MySpace and eBay, Amazon is paying the piper for not adjusting itself to the ever-changing Chinese market. Data from iiMedia Research showed that Amazon Chinas share in Chinas B2C market dropped to less than 1.2 percent in first half of 2018, while Tmall by Alibaba and JD.com take up 83.8 percent. Ten years ago, that number once reached 15.4 percent in a year. Their ability to localize and compete is not so good, said Wang Jian, professor from University of International Business and Economics. Lack of trust in the Amazon China team is the root cause. We react slow because the decision-making power falls in the hand of the American headquarters, said an insider who once worked at Amazon China. JD.com CEO Richard Liu agreed that what he felt most during JD.coms competition with Amazon was that Amazon didnt have trust in its China team. The Chinese market changes quickly. Without mass delegation of authority, its going to be a problem, said Liu on a show. Richard Liu talked about Amazon China on a show (source: Internet) Liu compared Amazon operating in China as a battle. You see, its president is always foreign, who has never lived in China. When soldiers are fighting on the front line and theyre given 10,000 bullets, they have to ask for one more bullet if ammo runs out, said Liu, How could they fight the battle that way? JD.coms trump card is its fast delivery, compared with its domestic rival Alibaba. Although Prime membership give users as fast as two days, its still slow compared with JD.coms one day or half a day delivery. Liu also bought items on Amazon.cn only to find disappointment, as it took him two days to receive them. How could they call that two-day delivery, Liu said. It will be a disaster in China. And every customer will be unhappy, Liu said, Customers expect to get their products within six hours; two days would be too long. Will cross-border be Amazons last straw? Slowly but gradually, Amazon China has been pivoting its focus from general e-commerce services to cross-border operations. Over the past few years, we have been evolving our China online retail business to increasingly emphasize cross-border sales, and in return weve seen very strong response from Chinese customers. Their demand for high-quality, authentic goods from around the world continues to grow rapidly, and given our global presence, Amazon is well-positioned to serve them, the company said in the statement. In February, Amazon China and NetEase Kaola, a Chinese cross-border e-commerce platform, are negotiating to merge their overseas purchase business. Meanwhile, its shutting down operations centers. According to China Business Journal, the first 15 centers have been closing, with those in Shanghai, Ningbo and Hongkong left open. It makes perfect sense to no longer operate Amazons third-party online marketplace. Shutting down is way better than suffering from deficit, said Wang. Will this action turn the tables for Amazon? Probably, if the company can stick to its quality products, modify the promotion strategy and adjust its management structure. Amazon is one of the first group of cross-border e-commerce platforms to join the battle. According to iiMedia,cn, the business in China gained initial development from 2010 to 2013, when buying agents targeting C2C and Little Red Book, or Xiaohongshu in Chinese, a user-generated content platform for discovering new lifestyle products started to emerge. More international e-commerce companies, such as Tmall, Amazon and NetEase entered the market within the next two years. And the competition has been upgrading since 2016. Quality products were what helped Amazon gain a firm foothold. The company gained trust from 30.1 percent Chinese mobile consumers, only second to NetEase Kaola (36.7 percent) in 2016, as iiMedia showed. Kaola maintained its lead with 27.1 percent share in the international retail market in 2018, with its high reputation and large user base, which were built on cost-effective, high-quality and trustworthy products. We have been committed to providing Chinese consumers with high-quality products from established international brands at competitive prices since the very first day, said Zhang Lei, CEO of NetEase Kaola. Chinas cross-border e-commerce market is a large cake which is still growing. The transaction scale reached CNY 9.1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) in 2018, and is expected to break CNY 11 trillion ($1.6 trillion) in 2019. Featured photo credit to Wall Street Journal ",
        "As a person have actually used TaoBao, JD, and Amazon.cn, I can tell Amazon.cn was far behind them on both execution and product variety.  I only have a vague impression of China's rules imposed on business, if they did, for sure Amazon was screwed so badly it didn't move a single inch over the past few years.  Literally done nothing at all to compete.  I'm not surprised they gave up.",
        "The discussion in this thread shows how blind people are about China's development. They are pointing fingers to the Chinese government partly because they simply cannot imagine how much better the China competitors are. The US do have some advantages in the IT industry, but that advantage is getting slimmer and slimmer. In fact, in so many ways, people in China are enjoying much better services from the internet companies than people in the US. But people in the US simply cannot see it, and cannot believe it. For ordinary people, I don't blame them. But most of people on HN are from this industry, and they are the same! This just makes me speechless."

        "It all started with a tweet: It refers to the current imbroglio surrounding Daryl Morey, the General Manager for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the latters dealings with China. The tweet, a reference to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong,1 hurt the feelings of the Chinese people (a rather frequent occurrence). The Global Times, a Chinese government-run English-language newspaper, stated in an editorial: Daryl Morey, general manager of the NBA team the Houston Rockets, has obviously gotten himself into trouble. He tweeted a photo saying fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong on Saturday while accompanying his team in Tokyo. The tweet soon set the teams Chinese fans ablaze. It can be imagined how Moreys tweet made them disappointed and furious. Shortly afterward, CCTV sports channel and Tencent sports channel both announced they would suspend broadcasting Rockets games. Some of the teams Chinese sponsors and business partners also started to suspend cooperation with the Rockets. Theres one rather glaring hole in this story of immediate outrage from Chinese fans over Moreys tweet: Twitter is banned in China. China Started It Earlier this year I wrote about the uneven playing field between the U.S. and China when it comes to technology companies. From China, Leverage, and Values: This is where I take the biggest issue with Culpan labeling this past weeks actions as the start of a tech cold war: China took the first shots, and they took them a long time ago. For over a decade U.S. services companies have been unilaterally shut out of the China market, even as Chinese alternatives had full reign, running on servers built with U.S. components (and likely using U.S. intellectual property) The truth is that the U.S. China relationship has been extremely one-sided for a very long time now: China buys the hardware it needs, and keeps all of the software opportunities for itself and, of course, pursues software opportunities abroad. This understated the case: not only were Chinese companies allowed into the U.S. while U.S. companies remained locked out of China, Chinese attacks on U.S. tech companies were allowed by Chinas censors, and in fact even augmented by the Great Firewall. James Griffiths wrote about the 2015 attack on Github earlier this year: In a paper coauthored with researchers at Citizen Lab, an activist and research group at the University of Toronto, Weaver described a new Chinese cyberweapon that he dubbed the Great Cannon. The Great Firewall an elaborate scheme of interrelated technologies for censoring internet content coming from outside Chinawas already well-known. Weaver and the Citizen Lab researchers found that not only was China blocking bits and bytes of data that were trying to make their way into China, but it was also channeling the flow of data out of China. Whoever was controlling the Great Cannon would use it to selectively insert malicious JavaScript code into search queries and advertisements served by Baidu, a popular Chinese search engine. That code then directed enormous amounts of traffic to the cannons targetsThe cannon could also be used for other malware attacks besides denial-of-service attacks. It was a powerful new tool: Deploying the Great Cannon is a major shift in tactics, and has a highly visible impact, Weaver and his coauthors wrote. The attack went on for days. The Citizen Lab team said they were able to observe its effects for two weeks after GitHubs alarms first went off. Afterward, as the GitHub developers struggled to make sense of the attack and come up with a road map for future incidents, there was confusion within the cybersecurity community. Why had China launched so public an attack, in such a blunt fashion? It was overkill, Weaver told me. They kept the attack going long after it had ceased working. It was a message: a shot across the bow from the architects of the Great Firewall, whohaving conquered the internet at homewere now increasingly taking aim overseas, unwilling to brook challenges to their system of control and censorship, no matter where they came from. The projects China was presumably targeting were Chinese versions of GreatFire.org, which documents censorship by the Great Firewall, and the New York Times, both of which were hosted on Github. Given the importance of Github to software development, China could not block the site completely, so instead they tried to hold it hostage. It was a harbinger of what happened this week. Dreams Versus Reality The story about engagement with China, both in terms of the U.S. generally but also tech specifically, has long been a belief that some engagement was better than no engagement, and that the shift to more freedom was inevitable. President Bill Clinton stated when the U.S. established Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China: The change this agreement can bring from outside is quite extraordinary, but I think you could make an argument that it will be nothing compared to the changes that this agreement will spark from the inside out in China. By joining the W.T.O., China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products; it is agreeing to import one of democracys most cherished values: economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. He added with regards to the Internet: In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem. In the past year, the number of Internet addresses in China has more than quadrupled, from 2 million to 9 million. This year the number is expected to grow to over 20 million. When China joins the W.T.O., by 2005 it will eliminate tariffs on information technology products, making the tools of communication even cheaper, better, and more widely available. We know how much the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open society. Imagine how much it could change China. Now theres no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet. Good luck! Thats sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall. But I would argue to you that their effort to do that just proves how real these changes are and how much they threaten the status quo. Its not an argument for slowing down the effort to bring China into the world, its an argument for accelerating that effort. In the knowledge economy, economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand. In fact, it turned out that China was able to first contain the Internet, blocking sites outside the Great Firewall, then control the Internet, censoring content on social networks like Weibo and WeChat, and, as this New York Times article explains, even leverage the Internet: The Communist Party indeed doesnt hesitate to use state power to tell the Chinese people how they should think. But the displays of patriotism, especially from young people, also show that the partys propaganda machine has mastered the power of symbol and symbolism in the mass media and social media eraWhile imposing tight censorship, the Communist Party has also learned to lean on the most popular artists and the most experienced internet companies to help it instill Chinese with patriotic zeal. Its propaganda for the Instagram age, if Instagram were allowed in China. The problem from a Western perspective is that the links Clinton was so sure would push in only one direction towards political freedom turned out to be two-way streets: China is not simply resisting Western ideals of freedom, but seeking to impose their own. Note this statement from state-owned broadcast CCTV, as it announced that it would not televise NBA games: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended Morey. I think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clearthat Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression, Silver said in an interview with Kyodo News in Tokyo Japan. CCTV did not agree with Silvers remarks. We are strongly dissatisfied and we oppose Silvers claim to support Moreys right of free expression. We believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech, CCTV said in its statement in Chinese, which was translated by CNBC. The lever for this rather radical definition of freedom of speech is the China market. The Global Times editorial I linked to above could not have been more explicit on this point: Respecting customers is a universal business rule. Morey has to choose between safeguarding his individual freedom of speech and protecting the Rockets commercial interests by respecting the feelings of Chinese fans. When he opted for the former, the Rockets will have to make a second choice from the perspective of the team. In other words, Morey, a private U.S. citizen posting an image on a social network already banned in China, had to be fired, or the Rockets and the NBA would quite literally pay the price. Abide by Chinas standards, or else. The TikTok Question Chinas exportation of its standards goes beyond brute force. Consider TikTok, the short-form video app owned by the $75 billion Chinese startup ByteDance, which has exploded onto Western markets over the last year. The Guardian reported last last month: TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social network, instructs its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, according to leaked documents detailing the sites moderation guidelines. The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app. The revelations come amid rising suspicion that discussion of the Hong Kong protests on TikTok is being censored for political reasons: a Washington Post report earlier this month noted that a search on the site for the city-state revealed barely a hint of unrest in sight. In fact, at least as of this afternoon, there is a hint of unrest on the site: while searches for Hong Kong show city views and high school students playing along with the latest TikTok meme, searching for Hong Kong in Chinese () brings up a video that shows the protestors as hooligans and vandals (this was the first result as of this afternoon, and the only video relating to the protests): There appear to be similar efforts in the case of the NBA controversy. Searching for the Warriors, Lakers, and Rockets brings up the sort of content you would expect: However, searching for the same team names in Chinese (, , and , respectively) shows basketball-related results for the first two and nothing related for the third: This should raise serious concern in the United States and other Western countries: is it at all acceptable to have a social network that has a demonstrated willingness to censor content under the control of a country that has clearly different views on what constitutes free speech? There is an established route for undoing this state of affairs: earlier this summer Chinas Kunlun Tech Company agreed to divest Grindr under pressure from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS); Kunlun Tech had acquired Grindr without undergoing CFIUS review. TikTok similarly acquired Musical.ly without oversight and relaunched it as TikTok for the Western market; it is worth at least considering the possibility of a review given TikToks apparent willingness to censor content for Western audiences according to Chinese government wishes. The NBAs Example Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, ultimately did do the right thing. In response to that CCTV cancellation Silver released a new statement that stated: Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game It is inevitable that people around the world including from America and China will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way. Silver added in a press conference following the statement: Part of the reason I issued the statement I did is because this afternoon, CCTV announced that because of my remarks supporting Daryl Moreys freedom of expression, not the substance of this statement but his freedom of expression, they were no longer going to air the Lakers-Nets preseason games that are scheduled for later this week. Again, its not something we expected to happen. I think its unfortunate. But if thats the consequence of us adhering to our values, we still feel its critically important we adhere to those values. I am increasingly convinced this is the point every company dealing with China will reach: what matters more, money or values? China Responses I am not particularly excited to write this article. My instinct is towards free trade, my affinity for Asia generally and Greater China specifically, my welfare enhanced by staying off Chinas radar. And yet, for all that the idea of being a global citizen is an alluring concept and largely my lived experience, I find in situations like this that I am undoubtedly a child of the West. I do believe in the individual, in free speech, and in democracy, no matter how poorly practiced in the United States or elsewhere. And, in situations like this weekend, when values meet money, I worry just how many companies are capable of choosing the former? The NBA, to its immense credit, appears to have done just that. Will technology companies be so brave? Certainly Google did so once before, exiting China in 2010 (albeit after both losing share to Baidu and being attacked by Chinese hackers). At the same time, the company appeared eager to reverse its decision, only terminating Project Dragonfly earlier this year; similarly, Facebook worked earnestly for approval its product team built a censorship apparatus and CEO Mark Zuckerberg learned Chinese only to give up last year. Both decisions appear motivated by the certainty of failure as opposed to core values. And then there is Apple: the company is deeply exposed to China both in terms of sales and especially when it comes to manufacturing. The reality is that, particularly when it comes to the latter, Apple doesnt have anywhere else to go. That, though, is where the companys massive cash stockpile and ability to generate more comes in handy: it is past time for the company to start spending heavily to build up alternatives. Sticking ones corporate head in the sand, praying that President Trump will not be re-elected and that everything will go back to normal, is deeply irresponsible both to shareholders and to the values Apple claims motivates them. The government response is also critical: I already argued that CFIUS should revisit TikToks acquisition of Musical.ly; the current skepticism around all Chinese investment in the United States should be continued if not increased. Attempts by China to leverage market access into self-censorship by U.S. companies should also be treated as trade violations that are subject to retaliation. Make no mistake, what happened to the NBA this weekend is nothing new: similar pressure has befallen multiple U.S. companies, often about content that is outside of Chinas borders (Taiwan and Hong Kong, for example, being listed in drop-down menus for hotels or airlines). The biggest, shift, though, is a mindset one. First, the Internet is an amoral force that reduces friction, not an inevitable force for good. Second, sometimes different cultures simply have fundamentally different values. Third, if values are going to be preserved, they must be a leading factor in economic entanglement, not a trailing one. This is the point that Clinton got the most wrong: money, like tech, is amoral. If we insist it matters most our own morals will inevitably disappear. I wrote a follow-up to this article in this Daily Update. This post is not about the specific issues driving the Hong Kong protests; it is useful to understand that China, particularly internally, has characterized the protests, which began when the Hong Kong government attempted to pass an extradition bill that would allow extradition to China, as a separatist movement driven by foreign powers. The protesters state their goals are not independence but rather that China honor its promises surrounding the transfer of Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, particularly in terms of universal suffrage ",
        "<i>Attempts by China to leverage market access into self-censorship by U.S. companies should also be treated as trade violations that are subject to retaliation.</i><p>Thank you, Ben, for this honest appraisal which involves sticking out your neck and perhaps even harming your ability to travel to China or expand your business.<p>Regarding this comment about Apple:<p><i>And then there is Apple: the company is deeply exposed to China both in terms of sales and especially when it comes to manufacturing. The reality is that, particularly when it comes to the latter, Apple doesn’t have anywhere else to go.</i><p>That may be true of manufacturing now, but will it be true 5 years from now? Surely Cook et al saw the writing on the wall years ago when it articulated some of its core values around privacy. Conflict is inevitable, and the risk associated with having all your manufacturing eggs in one basket is too great. We saw the announcement of Apple's manufacturing initiative in Texas, and there are other locations for electronics sourcing and assembly throughout Asia. How much of Apple's supply chain could be relocated elsewhere?",
        "It's frustrating to see people say that we shouldn't fight Chinese economic imperialism, mercantilism, and protectionism because we should support free trade.<p>Free trade is a two way street.  If a trading partner is engaging in unfair practices then it's reasonable to support sanctions and tariffs and other means to get them to stop, even if you're a free trade supporter.<p>In fact this is the whole premise of the WTO, which supports free trade.  If you don't engage in free trade, you get slapped with tariffs."

Many states follow a one-China policy, but the meanings are not the same.[1][2] The \"One-China policy\" concept is different from the \"One-China principle\", which is the principle that insists both Taiwan and mainland China are inalienable parts of a single \"China\".[3] A modified form of the \"One China\" principle known as the \"1992 Consensus\" is the current policy of the PRC government. Under this \"consensus\", both governments \"agree\" that there is only one sovereign state encompassing both mainland China and Taiwan, but disagree about which of the two governments is the legitimate government of this state. The One-China principle faces opposition from supporters of the Taiwan independence movement, which pushes to establish the \"Republic of Taiwan\" and cultivate a separate identity apart from China called \"Taiwanization\". Taiwanization's influence on the government of the ROC implies the change of self-identity among Taiwan citizens: after the Communist Party of China expelled the ROC in the Chinese Civil War from most of Chinese territory in 1949 and founded the PRC, the ROC's Chinese Nationalist government, which still held Taiwan, continued to claim legitimacy as the government of all of China. Under former President Lee Teng-hui, additional articles were appended to the ROC constitution in 1991 so that it applied effectively only to the Taiwan Area prior to national unification.[4] However, former ROC president Ma Ying-jeou re-asserted claims on mainland China as late as 2008.[5] Background[edit] Taiwan was referred as \"\" or \"YiZhou\" by ancient Chinese government. The Emperor Da of Wu Sun Quan deployed the first army to this islands in 230 AD[6]. The ancient Chinese book \"Linhai ShuiTu Zhi\" () first described Taiwan systematically[7]. In 1120, Taiwan was ruled by Quan Zhou. Taiwan was under the control of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga), a Ming-loyalist, in 1662 as the Kingdom of Tungning, before being incorporated by the Qing dynasty in 1683. A small part of Taiwan was ruled by the Dutch (16241662) and the Spanish (16261642, northern Taiwan only) when China was weak. The Japanese invaded and seized Taiwan for half a century (18951945), while France briefly held sway over northern Taiwan in 188485.[8] It was an outlying prefecture of Fujian Province under the Manchu Qing government of China from 1683 until 1887, when it was officially made a separate Fujian-Taiwan Province. Taiwan remained a province for eight years until it was ceded to Japan under the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895.[9][10] While Taiwan remained under Japanese control, the Qing dynasty was ousted and the First and Second Republic of China (ROC) were established from the Beiyang regime to the Kuomintang (KMT) from 1928. Following the October 1945 Japanese surrender ceremonies in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan Province, Taiwan once again became the governing polity of China during the period of military occupation.[11][12][13][14] In 1949, after losing control of most of mainland China following the Chinese Civil War, and before the post-war peace treaties had come into effect, the ROC government under the KMT withdrew to occupied Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek declared martial law. An argument has been made that Japan formally renounced all territorial rights to Taiwan in 1952 in the San Francisco Peace Treaty, but neither in that treaty nor in the peace treaty signed between Japan and China was the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan awarded to the Republic of China.[15][16] The treaties left the status of Taiwanas ruled by the ROC or PRCdeliberately vague, and the question of legitimate sovereignty over China is why China was not included in the San Francisco Peace Treaty.[15][16] This argument is not accepted by those who view the sovereignty of Taiwan as having been legitimately returned to the Republic of China at the end of the war.[17] Some argue that the ROC is a government in exile,[18][19][20][21] while others maintain it is a rump state.[22] The ROC government still governs Taiwan, but it transformed itself into a free and democratic state in the 1990s following decades of martial law.[23] During this period, the legal and political status of Taiwan has become more controversial, with more public expressions of Taiwan independence sentiments, which were formerly outlawed. Viewpoints within Taiwan[edit] Within Taiwan, there is a distinction between the positions of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The Kuomintang holds the \"One-China principle\" and maintains its claim that under the ROC Constitution (passed by the Kuomintang government in 1947 in Nanjing) the ROC has sovereignty over most of China, including, by their interpretation, both mainland China and Taiwan. After the Communist Party of China expelled the ROC in the Chinese Civil War from most of Chinese territory in 1949 and founded the PRC, the ROC's Chinese Nationalist government, which still held Taiwan, continued to claim legitimacy as the government of all of China. Under former President Lee Teng-hui, additional articles were appended to the ROC constitution in 1991 so that it applied effectively only to the Taiwan Area.[24] The Kuomintang proclaims a modified form of the \"One-China\" principle known as the \"1992 Consensus\". Under this \"consensus\", both governments \"agree\" that there is only one single sovereign state encompassing both mainland China and Taiwan, but disagree about which of the two governments is the legitimate government of this state. Former ROC President Ma Ying-jeou had re-asserted claims on mainland China as late as 8 October 2008.[25] The Democratic Progressive Party does not agree with the \"One-China principle\" as defined by the KMT or Two Chinas. Instead, it has a different interpretation, and believes \"China\" refers only to People's Republic of China and states that Taiwan and China are two separate countries, therefore there is One Country on Each Side and \"one China, one Taiwan\". The DPP's position is that the people of Taiwan have the right to self-determination without outside coercion.[26] Current president Tsai Ing-wen refuses to affirm the 1992 consensus. The PRC's One-China principle faces opposition from supporters of the Taiwan independence movement, which pushes to establish the \"Republic of Taiwan\" and cultivate a separate identity apart from China called \"Taiwanization\". Legal positions[edit] Map of territory the Kuomintang government of the ROC claimed after retreating to Taiwan Neither the ROC nor the PRC government recognizes the other as a legitimate national ruler. People's Republic of China (PRC)[edit] Preamble of the Constitution: Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China. It is the lofty duty of the entire Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.[27]Anti-Secession Law: Article 2: There is only one China in the world. Both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China. China's sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no division. Safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity is the common obligation of all Chinese people, the Taiwan compatriots included. Taiwan is part of China. The state shall never allow the \"Taiwan independence\" secessionist forces to make Taiwan secede from China under any name or by any means.[28] Article 5: Upholding the principle of one China is the basis of peaceful reunification of the country. To reunify the country through peaceful means best serves the fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The state shall do its utmost with maximum sincerity to achieve a peaceful reunification. After the country is reunified peacefully, Taiwan may practice systems different from those on the mainland and enjoy a high degree of autonomy.[28] Republic of China (ROC)[edit] Article 4 of the Constitution (Effective 1948 to 2000): \"The territory of the Republic of China according to its existing national boundaries shall not be altered except by resolution of the National Assembly.\"Article 4 of the 6th Additional Articles of the Constitution (Effective 2000 to 2005): \"The territory of the Republic of China, defined by its existing national boundaries, shall not be altered unless initiated upon the proposal of one-fourth of all members of the Legislative Yuan, passed by three-fourths of the members of the Legislative Yuan present at a meeting requiring a quorum of three-fourths of all the members, and approved by three-fourths of the delegates to the National Assembly present at a meeting requiring a quorum of two-thirds of all the delegates.\"Article 4 of the 7th Additional Articles of the Constitution (Effective 2005 to present): \"The territory of the Republic of China, defined by its existing national boundaries, shall not be altered unless initiated upon the proposal of one-fourth of the total members of the Legislative Yuan, passed by at least three-fourths of the members present at a meeting attended by at least three-fourths of the total members of the Legislative Yuan, and sanctioned by electors in the free area of the Republic of China at a referendum held upon expiration of a six-month period of public announcement of the proposal, wherein the number of valid votes in favor exceeds one-half of the total number of electors.\" In accordance with this legal position, legislation passed by the Legislative Yuan is signed by the President of the Republic of China. Only voters residing in the free area are eligible to vote and be elected in ROC elections. Evolution of the policy[edit] One interpretation, which was adopted during the Cold War, is that either the PRC or the ROC is the sole rightful government of all China and that the other government is illegitimate. While much of the western bloc maintained relations with the ROC until the 1970s under this policy, much of the eastern bloc maintained relations with the PRC. While the government of the ROC considered itself the remaining holdout of the legitimate government of a country overrun by what it thought of as Communist rebels, the PRC claimed to have succeeded the ROC in the Chinese Civil War. Though the ROC no longer portrays itself as the sole legitimate government of China, the position of the PRC remained unchanged until the early 2000s, when the PRC began to soften its position on this issue to promote Chinese reunification. The revised position of the PRC was made clear in the Anti-Secession Law of 2005, which although stating that there is one China whose sovereignty is indivisible, does not explicitly identify this China with the PRC. Almost all PRC laws have a suffix \"of the People's Republic of China\" (prefix in Chinese grammar) in their official names, but the Anti-Secession Law is an exception. Beijing has made no major statements after 2004 which identify one China with the PRC and has shifted its definition of one China slightly to encompass a concept called the '1992 Consensus': both sides of the Taiwan strait recognize there is only one Chinaboth mainland China and Taiwan belong to the same China but agree to differ on the definition of which China. One interpretation of one China is that only one geographical region of China exists, which was split between two Chinese governments during the Chinese Civil War. This is largely the position of current supporters of Chinese reunification in Mainland China, who believe that \"one China\" should eventually reunite under a single government. Starting in 2005, this position has become close enough to the position of the PRC, allowing high-level dialogue between the Communist Party of China and the Pan-Blue Coalition of the ROC. Policy position in the PRC[edit] In practice, official sources and state-owned media never refer to the \"ROC government\", and seldom to the \"government of Taiwan\". Instead, the government in Taiwan is referred to as the \"Taiwan authorities\". The PRC does not accept or stamp Republic of China passports. Instead, a Taiwan resident visiting Mainland China must use a Taiwan Compatriot Entry Permit. Hong Kong grants visa free entry to holders of a Permit; while holders of a ROC passport must apply for a Pre-arrival Registration. Macau grants visa free entry to holders of both the permit and the passport. Policy position in the ROC[edit] The only official statement of the ROC on its interpretation of the One-China principle dates back to 1 August 1992. At that time, the National Unification Council of the ROC expressed the ROC's interpretation of the principle as:[29] The two sides of the Strait have different opinions as to the meaning of \"one China.\" To Beijing, \"one China\" means \"the People's Republic of China (PRC),\" with Taiwan to become a \"Special Administrative Region\" after unification. Taipei, on the other hand, considers \"one China\" to mean the Republic of China (ROC), founded in 1912 and with de jure sovereignty over all of China. The modern-day ROC, however, has jurisdiction only over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. Taiwan is part of China, and the Chinese mainland is part of China as well. Since 1949, China has been temporarily divided, and each side of the Taiwan Strait is administered by a separate political entity. This is an objective reality that no proposal for China's unification can overlook. In February 1991, the government of the Republic of China, resolutely seeking to establish consensus and start the process of unification, adopted the \"Guidelines for National Unification\". This was done to enhance the progress and well-being of the people, and the prosperity of the nation. The ROC government sincerely hopes that the mainland authorities will adopt a pragmatic attitude, set aside prejudices, and cooperate in contributing its wisdom and energies toward the building of a free, democratic and prosperous China. However, political consensus and public opinion in Taiwan has evolved since 1992. There is significant difference between each faction's recognition for and understanding of the One-China principle. The Pan-Blue Coalition parties, consisting of the Kuomintang, the People First Party, and the New Party, accept the One-China principle. In particular, former President of the Republic of China, Ma Ying-jeou, stated in 2006 when he was the Kuomintang chairman that \"One China is the Republic of China\". Until the 1990s, the government actively stated that the ROC is the only legitimate \"One China\" while the PRC is illegitimate. The Pan-Green Coalition parties, consisting of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, are more hostile to the policy, as they view Taiwan as a country separate from China. The former ROC President, Chen Shui-bian of the DPP, regards acceptance of the \"One China\" principle as capitulation to the PRC, and prefers to view it as nothing more than a topic for discussion, in opposition to the PRC's insistence that the \"One China\" principle is a prerequisite for any negotiation. When the Republic of China established diplomatic relations with Kiribati in 2003 the ROC officially declared that Kiribati could continue to have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.[citation needed] Despite the declaration, however, all countries maintaining official ties with Taipei continue to recognize the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China.[30] The ROC does not recognize or stamp PRC passports. Instead, Chinese residents visiting Taiwan and other territory under ROC jurisdiction must use an Exit and Entry Permit issued by the ROC authorities. Diplomatic relations[edit] PRC embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine. Ukraine does not recognize the ROC. PRC embassy in Canberra, Australia. Australia does not officially recognize the ROC, although it has unofficial relations with it. ROC economic and cultural office in Tokyo, Japan. Japan recognizes the PRC, though it also has informal relations with the ROC. The One-China policy is a requirement for any political entity to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The PRC has, in the past, attempted to get nations to recognize that \"the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China ... and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.\" However, many nations are unwilling to make this particular statement and there was often a protracted effort to find language regarding one China that is acceptable to both sides. All countries that have established formal diplomatic ties with the PRC use terms such as \"respects\", \"acknowledge\", \"understand\", \"take note of\", which does not recognize PRC sovereignty over Taiwan and other ROC governed territories. This strategic ambiguity in the language used provides the basis for countries to have formal ties with People's Republic of China and maintain unofficial ties to the Republic of China. PRC government policy mandates that any country that wishes to establish diplomatic relationship with the PRC must first discontinue any formal relationship with the ROC. According to The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, \"non-recognition of the Taiwanese government is a prerequisite for conducting formal diplomatic relations with the PRC in effect forcing other governments to choose between Beijing and Taipei.\"[31][32] In order to compete for other countries' recognition, each Chinese government has given money to a certain few small countries. Both the PRC and ROC governments have accused each other of monetary diplomacy. Several small African and Caribbean countries have established and discontinued diplomatic relationships with both sides several times in exchange for huge financial support from each side.[33] The name \"Chinese Taipei\" is used in some international arenas since \"Taiwan\" suggests that Taiwan is a separate country and \"Republic of China\" suggests that there are two Chinas, and thus both violate the One-China principle. Taiwan could also be used as shorthand for the Customs Union between Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. For example, in Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) Declaration on the March 2007 elections, issued on behalf of the European Union and with support of 37 countries, express mention is made of \"Taiwan.\" Most countries that recognize Beijing circumvent the diplomatic language by establishing \"Trade Offices\" that represent their interests on Taiwanese soil, while the ROC government represents its interests abroad with TECRO, Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. The United States (and any other nation having diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China) does not have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC. Instead, external relations are handled via nominally private organizations such as the American Institute in Taiwan or the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei. As for the Philippines, the unofficial Embassy is called the Manila Economic and Cultural Office. Though it is a cultural and economic office, the website explicitly says that it is the \"Philippine Representative Office in Taiwan\". It also offers various consular services, such as granting visa and processing passport. U.S. policy[edit] In the case of the United States, the One-China policy was first stated in the Shanghai Communiqu of 1972: \"the United States acknowledges that Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States does not challenge that position.\" The United States has not expressed an explicitly immutable statement regarding whether it believes Taiwan is independent or not. Instead, Washington simply states that they understand the PRC's claims on Taiwan as its own. In fact, many scholars[who?] agree that U.S. One-China policy was not intended to please the PRC government, but as a way for Washington to conduct international relations in the region, which Beijing fails to state. A more recent study suggests that this wording reflected the Nixon administration's desire to shift responsibility for resolving the dispute to the \"people most directly involved\" that is, China and Taiwan. At the same time, the United States would avoid \"prejudic[ing] the ultimate outcome\" by refusing to explicitly support the claims of one side or the other.[34] At the height of the Sino-Soviet split and Sino-Vietnamese conflict, and at the start of the reform and opening of the PRC, the United States strategically switched diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China (ROC) to the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 January 1979. When President Jimmy Carter in 1979 broke off relations with the ROC in order to establish relations with the PRC, Congress responded by passing the Taiwan Relations Act that maintained relations, but stopped short of full recognition of the ROC. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan also saw that the Six Assurances were adopted, the fifth being that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, United States policy has remained ambiguous. In the House International Relations Committee on 21 April 2004, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, James A. Kelly, was asked by Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) whether the United States government's commitment to Taiwan's democracy conflicted with the so-called One-China policy.[35] He stated \"In my testimony, I made the point \"our One China,\" and I didn't really define it, and I'm not sure I very easily could define it. I can tell you what it is not. It is not the One-China policy or the One-China principle that Beijing suggests, and it may not be the definition that some would have in Taiwan. But it does convey a meaning of solidarity of a kind among the people on both sides of the straits that has been our policy for a very long time.\"[36] U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Obama supported the \"One-China\" policy during his administration.[37] The position of the United States, as clarified in the China/Taiwan: Evolution of the \"One China\" Policy report of the Congressional Research Service (date: 9 July 2007) is summed up in five points: The United States did not explicitly state the sovereign status of Taiwan in the three US-PRC Joint Communiques of 1972, 1979, and 1982. The United States \"acknowledged\" the \"One China\" position of both sides of the Taiwan Strait. U.S. policy has not recognized the PRC's sovereignty over Taiwan; U.S. policy has not recognized Taiwan as a sovereign country; and U.S. policy has considered Taiwan's status as unsettled. These positions remained unchanged in a 2013 report of the Congressional Research Service.[38] On 2 December 2016, US President-elect Donald Trump and ROC President Tsai Ing-wen conducted a short phone call regarding \"the close economic, political and security ties between Taiwan and the US\".[39] On 6 December, a few days after the call, Trump said that the US is not necessarily bound by its \"one China\" policy.[40][41][42] On 9 February 2017, in a lengthy phone call, US President Donald Trump and PRC Paramount leader Xi Jinping discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed, at the request of Xi Jinping, to honor the \"one China\" policy.[43] U.S. public opinion on the One-China Policy[edit] U.S. public opinion on the One-China Policy is much more ambiguous than the opinions of the American political elites and policy experts. A Pew Research poll from 2012 found that 84% of policy experts believed it to be very important to for the U.S. to build a strong relationship with China, whereas only 55% of the general public agreed with that statement.[44] This vast difference of agreement between policy experts and the American public is illustrated by Donald Trump's phone call 25 days after his inauguration to the President of Taiwan, breaking a decades-old policy that could be an expression of negative attitudes towards the People's Republic of China.[45] Furthermore, U.S. popular attitudes towards the People's Republic of China are negative, where China is viewed as an economic adversary rather than a friendly rival. A 2015 Pew Research poll found that 60% of Americans view the loss of jobs to China as very serious, compared to only 21% who view the tensions between China and Taiwan as very serious.[46] Historical trends conducted by Gallup demonstrate an increase in perception among Americans that China is the leading economic power in the world today, with polls in 2000 showing only 10% agreeing with that statement and in 2016, 50% concurring with the statement.[47] Cross-strait relations[edit] The acknowledgment of the One-China principle is also a prerequisite by the People's Republic of China government for any cross-strait dialogue be held with groups from Taiwan. The PRC's One-China policy rejects formulas which call for \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan\"[48] and has stated that efforts to divide the sovereignty of China could be met with military force.[citation needed] The PRC has explicitly stated that it is flexible about the meaning \"one China\", and that \"one China\" may not necessarily be synonymous with the PRC, and has offered to talk with parties on Taiwan and the government on Taiwan on the basis of the Consensus of 1992 which states that there is one China, but that there are different interpretations of that one China. For example, in Premier Zhu Rongji's statements prior to the 2000 Presidential Election in Taiwan, he stated that as long as any ruling power in Taiwan accepts the One-China principle, they can negotiate and discuss anything freely. However, the One-China principle would apparently require that Taiwan formally give up any possibility of Taiwanese independence, and would preclude any \"one nation, two states\" formula similar to ones used in German Ostpolitik or in Korean reunification. Chen Shui-bian, president of the Republic of China between 2000 and 2008 repeatedly rejected the demands to accept the One-China principle and instead called for talks to discuss One China itself. With the January and March 2008 elections in Taiwan, and the election of Ma Ying-jeou as the President of the ROC, who was inaugurated on 20 May, a new era of better relations between both sides of the Taiwan Strait was established.[49] KMT officials visited Mainland China, and the Chinese ARATS met in Beijing with its Taiwanese counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation. Direct charter flights were therefore established. One China was the formulation held by the ROC government before the 1990s, but it was asserted that the one China was the Republic of China rather than PRC. However, in 1991, President Lee Teng-hui indicated that he would not challenge the Communist authorities to rule mainland China. This is a significant point in the history of Cross-Strait relations in that a president of the ROC no longer claims administrative authority over mainland China. Henceforth, the Taiwan independence movement gained a political boost, and under Lee's administration the issue is no longer who rules mainland China, but who claims legitimacy over Taiwan and the surrounding islands. Over the course of the 1990s, President Lee appeared to drift away from the One-China formulation, leading many to believe that he was actually sympathetic to Taiwan independence. In 1999, Lee proposed a special state-to-state relations for mainland ChinaTaiwan relations which was received angrily by Beijing, which ended semi-official dialogue until June 2008, when ARATS and SEF met, and in which President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated the 1992 Consensus and the different interpretation on \"One China\". After the election of Chen Shui-bian in 2000, the policy of the ROC government was to propose negotiations without preconditions. While Chen did not explicitly reject Lee's two states theory, he did not explicitly endorse it either. Throughout 2001, there were unsuccessful attempts to find an acceptable formula for both sides, such as agreeing to \"abide by the 1992 consensus\". Chen, after assuming the Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship in July 2002, moved to a somewhat less ambiguous policy, and stated in early August 2002 that \"it is clear that both sides of the straits are separate countries\". This statement was strongly criticized by opposition Pan-Blue Coalition parties on Taiwan, which support a One-China principle, but oppose defining this \"One China\" as the PRC. The One-China policy became an issue during the 2004 ROC Presidential election. Chen Shui-bian abandoned his earlier ambiguity and publicly rejected the One-China principle claiming it would imply that Taiwan is part of the PRC. His opponent Lien Chan publicly supported a policy of \"one China, different interpretations\", as done in 1992. At the end of the 2004 election, Lien Chan and his running mate, James Soong, later announced that they would not put ultimate unification as the goal for their cross-strait policy and would not exclude the possibility of an independent Taiwan in the future. In an interview with Time Asia bureau prior to the 2004 presidential elections, Chen used the model of Germany and the European Union as examples of how countries may come together, and the Soviet Union as illustrating how a country may fragment. In March 2005, the PRC passed an Anti-Secession Law which authorized the use of force to prevent a \"serious incident\" that breaks the One-China policy, but which at the same time did not identify one China with the People's Republic and offered to pursue political solutions. At the same session of the PRC Congress, a large increase in military spending was also passed, leading blue team members to interpret those measures as forcing the ROC to adhere to the One-China policy or else the PRC would attack. In April and May 2005, Lien Chan and James Soong made separate trips to Mainland China,[50] during which both explicitly supported the Consensus of 1992 and the concept of one China and in which both explicitly stated their parties' opposition to Taiwan independence. Although President Chen at one point supported the trips of Lien and Soong for defusing cross-strait tensions,[51] he also attacked them for working with the \"enemy\" PRC[citation needed]. On 28 April 2008, Honorary Chairman Lien Chan of the then opposition Kuomintang visited Beijing and met with Hu Jintao for the fourth time since their historic encounter on 29 April 2005 in their respective capacity as party leaders of both the Chinese Communist Party and the KMT. Lien also met Chen Yunlin, director of the PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.[52] On 28 May 2008, Kuomintang Chairman Wu Po-hsiung made a landmark visit to Beijing,[53] and met and shook hands with the Communist General Secretary Hu Jintao, at the Great Hall of the People. He also visited the mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen. Hu Jintao called for resuming exchanges and talks, based on the 1992 Consensus, between mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), as early as possible, and practically solving problems concerning the two sides through talks on equal footing. Once the ARATS-SEF dialogue is resumed, priority should be given to issues including cross-Strait weekend chartered flights and approval for mainland China residents traveling to Taiwan, which are of the biggest concern to people on both sides of the Strait. \"The KMT has won two important elections in Taiwan recently,\" Wu said, \"which showed that the mainstream opinion of the Taiwan people identified with what the KMT stood for, and most of the Taiwan people agree that the two sides on the strait can achieve peaceful development and a win-win situation\".[54] Wu also told reporters that he had stressed to Hu that Taiwan needed an international presence. \"The Taiwanese people need a sense of security, respect and a place in the international community\", Wu said. Hu was also quoted as having promised to discuss feasible measures for Taiwan to take part in international activities, particularly its participation in World Health Organization activities.[55] See also[edit] 1992 Consensus Chinese unification Exclusive mandate Political status of Taiwan Taiwanization Timeline of diplomatic relations of the Republic of China Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China References[edit] ^ \"What is the 'One China' policy?\".

        "Tim Culpan declared at Bloomberg that The Tech Cold War Has Begun after the Trump administration barred companies viewed as national security threats from selling to the U.S., and blocked U.S. companies from selling to Huawei specifically without explicit permission. Culpan writes: The prospect that the U.S. government would cut off the supply of components to Huawei was precisely what management had been anticipating for close to a year, Bloomberg News reported Friday. Huawei has at least three months of supplies stockpiled. Thats not a lot, but it speaks to the seriousness with which the Shenzhen-based company took the threat. Theres hope that this latest escalation is just part of the U.S.s trade-war posturing and will be resolved as part of broader negotiations. Huawei, or Chinese leaders, are unlikely to be so naive as to share that. Even the briefest of bans will be proof to them that China can no long rely on outsiders. We can now expect China to redouble efforts to roll out a homegrown smartphone operating system, design its own chips, develop its own semiconductor technology (including design tools and manufacturing equipment), and implement its own technology standards. This can only accelerate the process of creating a digital iron curtain that separates the world into two distinct, mutually exclusive technological spheres. I agree with Culpans overall conclusions, and dived into some of the short and medium-term implications of the Trump administrations action in yesterdays Daily Update. However, to the extent that a tech Cold War has begun, that is only because a war takes two. The ZTE Ban Huaweis preparation for this moment likely started last year when a similar ban was placed on the sale of American components to ZTE; as I explained at the time: Obviously the United States government cannot tell a Chinese company what to do. However, the U.S. government can tell American companies what to do, and that includes determining what technology can be exported, and to whom. To that end, countries like Iran and North Korea have long been subject to U.S. sanctions, which means that it is illegal for U.S. companies in many sectors, particularly technology-related ones, to export products to those countries (including digital products like licensed software). And, by extension, U.S. companies cannot knowingly export embargoed products to companies that then sell those products to countries covered by those sanctions. That ZTE was flouting those sanctions was well-known, and the company settled with the U.S. government in 2017. The action last year, then, was in response to ZTE allegedly violating that settlement; at the same time, it was hard not to wonder if there was any relation to the ongoing trade dispute with China? Similar questions surround this Huawei action: the Trump administration ultimately made a deal to spare ZTE, and a waiver has already been granted allowing Huawei to service existing networks and phones in the U.S. Still, if youre looking for the start of this tech cold war, the move against ZTE was arguably the bigger deal: for the first time the extreme vulnerability Chinas tech giants have to U.S. action was laid bare. The U.S. Advantage While tech devices like iPhones are Made in China, it is important to note that little of the technology originates there less than $10 worth, in fact. Much more goes to component suppliers in the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan1 (and obviously, even more goes to Apple itself). The reality is that China is still relatively far behind when it comes to the manufacture of most advanced components, and very far behind when it comes to both advanced processing chips and also the equipment that goes into designing and fabricating them. Yes, Huawei has its own system-on-a-chip, but it is a relatively bog-standard ARM design that even then relies heavily on U.S. software. China may very well be committed to becoming technologically independent, but that is an effort that will take years. That is why the best that Huawei could do over the last year was stockpile supplies: the U.S. retains a significant upper-hand in this war. At the same time, cutting off Chinese customers like Huawei will cost U.S. suppliers dearly: high-value components by definition entail very large research and development costs and significant capital outlays for their manufacture; that means that profit comes from volume, and losing a massive customer like Huawei would be costly. China has one other card to play: rare earth elements. These 17 elements2 are essential for electronic components, and China dominates their production, accounting for over 90% of the worlds supply. The country flexed its power in 2010, imposing export quotas (which were later ruled illegal by the WTO) that caused prices to skyrocket, at least for non-Chinese companies, giving Chinese companies an advantage. To that end, it is certainly not a coincidence that Chinese President Xi Jinping toured a rare earth mining and processing center yesterday, accompanied by Chinas top trade negotiator. Chinas Protectionism Chinas 2010 rare earth export reduction wasnt the only shot the country has taken: in January of that year Google announced that its network had been hacked by China, resulting in the theft of intellectual property, and that the company was reevaluating its approach to the Chinese market. Soon after Google closed down its China operations and directed users to its Hong Kong site, which was summarily blocked by the Great Firewall. Google was hardly alone in this regard: YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook were all blocked in 2009, and since Googles block sites like Instagram, Dropbox, Pinterest, Reddit, and Discord have been as well, along with a whole host of media sites like the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and Wikipedia. Indeed, this is where I take the biggest issue with labeling this past weeks actions as the start of a tech cold war: China took the first shots, and they took them a long time ago. For over a decade U.S. services companies have been unilaterally shut out of the China market, even as Chinese alternatives had full reign, running on servers built with U.S. components (and likely using U.S. intellectual property).3 To be sure, Chinas motivation was not necessarily protectionism, at least in the economic sense: what mattered most to the countrys ruling Communist Party was control of the flow of information. At the same time, from a narrow economic perspective, the truth is that China has been limiting the economic upside of U.S. companies far longer than the U.S. has tried to limit Chinas. Not that the U.S. investor class cared: for U.S. component suppliers China provided not only revenue but scale; for hardware manufacturers like Apple China provided low labor costs and an increasingly sophisticated base of manufacturing expertise, and full-on design services for more commoditized OEMs like PC makers. And while U.S. services may not have been allowed in China, U.S. venture capital money was certainly allowed to invest in Chinese startups. The truth is that the U.S. China relationship has been extremely one-sided for a very long time now: China buys the hardware it needs, and keeps all of the software opportunities for itself and, of course, pursues software opportunities abroad. At the same time, U.S. acquiescence to this state of affairs has denied China the necessary motivation to actually make the investments necessary to replace U.S. hardware completely, leading to this specific moment in time. A Question of Leverage To that end, and leaving aside broader questions about the Trump administrations approach to trade with China, when it comes to a tech cold war I think the U.S. has the most leverage it ever will have: the U.S. advantage in advanced components, particularly processors and their fabrication, is massive, and will only grow if the U.S. is able to gain the support of countries like South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Yes, China will spend whatever is necessary to catch up, but it will take a lot of time. The primary potential pain points for the U.S., meanwhile, are those same component manufacturers that China needs, whose revenue and profits will be hurt, rare earths, and Apple. The latter is more exposed to China than anyone, on two fronts: first, the companys massive manufacturing facilities in China, and second, the importance of the Chinese consumer market to the iPhone in particular. This does not guarantee that Apple will be retaliated against: Apple employs millions of Chinese, both directly in manufacturing and also component suppliers, and the Chinese leadership will be loath to leave any of them unemployed. And, on the flipside, Chinese consumers, particularly those in influential first-tier cities, like Apple products. I do think the latter is more likely to be impacted than the former: China can do a lot to disrupt Apples consumer-facing operations in China, as they already have in both services and iPhone sales. The other big question is if the Trump administration will levy tariffs on iPhones for U.S. consumers: to date Apple has been largely spared, but the U.S. is running out of goods to slap tariffs on; again the company benefits from its popularity with end users, who would be much more sensitive to a rise in iPhone prices than just about anything else. A Question of Values For obvious reasons, I think most people in tech are opposed to the Trump administrations approach: not only is Trump unpopular in Silicon Valley generally (which means his policies are), but the near-term damage to U.S. tech companies could be significant. At the same time, as someone who has argued that technology is an amoral force, China gives me significant pause. On one hand, while the shift of manufacturing to China has hurt the industrial heartlands of both the U.S. and Europe, nothing in history has had a greater impact on the alleviation of poverty and suffering of humanity generally than Chinas embrace of capitalism and globalization, protectionist though it may have been. Technology, particularly improvements in global communication and transportation capabilities, played a major role in that. On the other hand, for all of the praise that is heaped on Chinese service companies like Tencent for their innovation, the fact that everything on Tencent is monitored and censored is chilling, particularly when people disappear. The possibilities of a central government creating the conditions for, say, self-driving cars or some other top-down application of technology is appealing, but turning a city into a prison through surveillance is terrifying. And while it is tempting to fantasize about removing fake news and hateful content with an iron fist, it is a step down the road to removing everything that is objectionable to an unaccountable authority with little more than an adjustment to a configuration file. This is the true war when it comes to technology: censorship versus openness, control versus creativity, and centralization versus competition. These are, of course, connected: Chinas censorship is about control facilitated by centralization. That, though, should not only give Western tech companies and investors pause about China generally, but should also lead to serious introspection about the appropriate policies towards our own tech industry. Openness, creativity, and competition are just as related as their counterparts, and infringement on any one of them should be taken as a threat to all three. I wrote a follow-up to this article in this Daily Update. The relative order varies based on the iPhone model; the iPhones XS, for example, gets its very expensive OLED screen from Samsung in South Korea, and its processor from TSMC in Taiwan. Previous iPhone models sources screens from Japan and processors from Samsung.The elements are cerium (Ce), dysprosium (Dy), erbium (Er), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), holmium (Ho), lanthanum (La), lutetium (Lu), neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), scandium (Sc), terbium (Tb), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and yttrium (Y) This doesnt even address rampant piracy in China: the country was one of Microsofts largest markets by usage, but drove revenue equivalent to the Netherlands.

        "The fundamental questions that America needs to answer are:<p>What are the aspects of the current economic relationship with China that are beneficial to the US, and what are the aspects that are harmful.<p>What policies should it adopt to manage its relationships with China while maintaining its values. Whether it should act unilaterally to achieve those objectives, or coordinate with its allies.<p>What are the near-term and long-term consequences of Cooperating with China vs. Competing with China in a new cold war, considering China's power will likely rise in comparison with the US's.",

        "A HUNDRED YEARS ago a wave of student protests broke over Chinas great cities. Desperate to reverse a century of decline, the leaders of the May Fourth Movement wanted to jettison Confucianism and import the dynamism of the West. The creation of a modern China would come about, they argued, by recruiting Mr Science and Mr Democracy.Listen to this storyYour browser does not support the <audio> element.Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Today the country that the May Fourth students helped shape is more than ever consumed by the pursuit of national greatness. Chinas landing of a spacecraft on the far side of the Moon on January 3rd, a first for any country, was a mark of its soaring ambition. But todays leaders reject the idea that Mr Science belongs in the company of Mr Democracy. On the contrary, President Xi Jinping is counting on being able to harness leading-edge research even as the Communist Party tightens its stranglehold on politics. Amid the growing rivalry between China and America, many in the West fear that he will succeed.There is no doubting Mr Xis determination. Modern science depends on money, institutions and oodles of brainpower. Partly because its government can marshal all three, China is hurtling up the rankings of scientific achievement, as our investigations show (see article). It has spent many billions of dollars on machines to detect dark matter and neutrinos, and on institutes galore that delve into everything from genomics and quantum communications to renewable energy and advanced materials. An analysis of 17.2m papers in 2013-18, by Nikkei, a Japanese publisher, and Elsevier, a scientific publisher, found that more came from China than from any other country in 23 of the 30 busiest fields, such as sodium-ion batteries and neuron-activation analysis. The quality of American research has remained higher, but China has been catching up, accounting for 11% of the most influential papers in 2014-16.Such is the pressure on Chinese scientists to make breakthroughs that some put ends before means. Last year He Jiankui, an academic from Shenzhen, edited the genomes of embryos without proper regard for their post-partum welfareor that of any children they might go on to have. Chinese artificial-intelligence (AI) researchers are thought to train their algorithms on data harvested from Chinese citizens with little oversight. In 2007 China tested a space-weapon on one of its weather satellites, littering orbits with lethal space debris. Intellectual-property theft is rampant.The looming prospect of a dominant, rule-breaking, high-tech China alarms Western politicians, and not just because of the new weaponry it will develop. Authoritarian governments have a history of using science to oppress their own people. China already deploys AI techniques like facial recognition to monitor its population in real time. The outside world might find a China dabbling in genetic enhancement, autonomous AIs or geoengineering extremely frightening.These fears are justified. A scientific superpower wrapped up in a one-party dictatorship is indeed intimidating. But the effects of Chinas growing scientific clout do not all point one way.For a start, Chinese science is about much more than weapons and oppression. From better batteries and new treatments for disease to fundamental discoveries about, say, dark matter, the world has much to gain from Chinas efforts.Moreover, it is unclear whether Mr Xi is right. If Chinese research really is to lead the field, then science may end up changing China in ways he is not expecting.Mr Xi talks of science and technology as a national project. However, in most scientific research, chauvinism is a handicap. Expertise, good ideas and creativity do not respect national frontiers. Research takes place in teams, which may involve dozens of scientists. Published papers get you only so far: conferences and face-to-face encounters are essential to grasp the subtleties of what everyone else is up to. There is competition, to be sure; military and commercial research must remain secret. But pure science thrives on collaboration and exchange.This gives Chinese scientists an incentive to observe international rulesbecause that is what will win its researchers access to the best conferences, laboratories and journals, and because unethical science diminishes Chinas soft power. Mr Hes gene-editing may well be remembered not just for his ethical breach, but also for the furious condemnation he received from his Chinese colleagues and the threat of punishment from the authorities. The satellite destruction in 2007 caused outrage in China. It has not been repeated.The tantalising question is how this bears on Mr Democracy. Nothing says the best scientists have to believe in political freedom. And yet critical thinking, scepticism, empiricism and frequent contact with foreign colleagues threaten authoritarians, who survive by controlling what people say and think. Soviet Russia sought to resolve that contradiction by giving its scientists privileges, but isolating many of them in closed cities.China will not be able to corral its rapidly growing scientific elite in that way. Although many researchers will be satisfied with just their academic freedom, only a small number need seek broader self-expression to cause problems for the Communist Party. Think of Andrei Sakharov, who developed the Russian hydrogen bomb, and later became a chief Soviet dissident; or Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist who inspired the students leading the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. When the official version of reality was tired and stilted, both stood out as seekers of the truth. That gave them immense moral authority.Some in the West may feel threatened by Chinas advances in science, and therefore aim to keep its researchers at arms length. That would be wise for weapons science and commercial research, where elaborate mechanisms to preserve secrecy already exist and could be strengthened. But to extend an arms-length approach to ordinary research would be self-defeating. Collaboration is the best way of ensuring that Chinese science is responsible and transparent. It might even foster the next Fang.Hard as it is to imagine, Mr Xi could end up facing a much tougher choice: to be content with lagging behind, or to give his scientists the freedom they need and risk the consequences. In that sense, he is running the biggest experiment of all.This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \"Red moon rising\" ",

        "Not could, is. With the exception of the US, China is already ahead of all other countries. A friend who's one of the top quantum physicists in the world recently returned from a stint in China. He told me that the University lab he was at had more equipment and resources than exist in the entire country of Australia. Within 10-25 years it will become compulsory for western scientists to learn Chinese. They simply value science far more so than we do in the western countries."

        "When did Europe become so afraid of China? Last month, the European Commission published its much-awaited new strategic outlook on China. The document offers up sweeping judgments on Chinas development strategy and 10 detailed responses. It is written in the usual technocratic jargon that is second, or even first, nature to officials in Brussels, but it also shows signs of a more political approach. China is described as a systemic rival, whose economic power and political influence have grown with unprecedented scale and speed. Theres been a significant change in Europes attitude to Beijing. Not too long ago, Europeans shrugged at Chinas rise. Overnight, it seems, their world changed. So, why did the tide turn? And how did we get here? First, there was the story of the solar panels. European producers once enjoyed a clear first-mover advantage, and yet the industry has been all but wiped out in Europe. Look at the list of the worlds 10 largest solar-panel manufacturers. In 2001, five were European. In 2018, eight were Chinese; the other two were Canadian and South Korean. Then there was Kuka, the crown jewel of German robotics, which was taken over by Chinese home-appliance maker Midea in 2016. What happened next has become part of a now recognizable pattern: Once a firm is acquired by a Chinese company, its European suppliers are abandoned for Chinese value chains.

U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing estimates that over the next two decades China will need 7,690 new planes, valued at $1.2 trillion. This is a huge opportunity for Chinas domestic industry, and Beijing has marked aerospace and aviation equipment as one of 10 strategic industries it is boosting through its Made in China 2025 initiative. Industry experts estimate that it will take China 10 years to be able to compete with Boeing and Airbus. But this doesnt mean China is far behind its Western competitors. Ten years will go by quickly. By 2030, the last holdouts will have fallen, and Europe will be under the imminent threat of being swallowed up by a country three or four times the size of the European Union. There is something predatory going on here. The question though is: Is it China? Or is this just the way the world works and has always worked? Things would be different if the EU were a genuine political union. Recently I had lunch with a British diplomat in Beijing. As I described what a Chinese-led world order might look like, he sat back in his chair and commented with a wry smile: Looks like the British empire to me. It also looks like the American empire. The British empire may be gone, but its American cousin is very much alive. As the recent trade war shows, once the United States feels threatened by China, it can bring Beijing to the negotiating table. Boeing may be as vulnerable to Chinese competition as Europes Airbus, but the company can count on America to come to its aid in an hour of need. The EU would not be able to muster a similar feat. It is too divided. Today, even a simple vote in the Council of the EU cant gather the necessary unanimity if the decision is seen to clash with Chinese interests in Europe. Countries such as Hungary or Greece long courted by China and keen to keep Beijing happy will veto it. Things would be different if the EU were a genuine political union there would be no Hungarian or Greek veto. Capitals would lose their competence in foreign policy and a fully democratic common power would be fully in charge of external relations. Europeans have been trying to achieve such a political union for the last 70 years, but is has remained an unfulfilled promise. Perhaps thats because the EU lacks the most basic ingredient of political unity: the fear of an external threat. Chinese President Xi Jinping accompanies French President Emmanuel Macron in Beijing, 2018 | Lintao Zhang via Getty Images The U.S. has played a critical and often overlooked role in eliminating this perception of a common enemy. By extending an unconditional security guarantee to its allies, it ensured that the Soviet Union would never become an existential threat to Europe. At the same time, American society and politics were too similar to Europes in their values and aims for Washingtons allies across the Atlantic to feel genuinely threatened by the extent of American power. This geopolitical limbo was comfortable enough. It allowed Europe to take a long holiday from history. It prevented a political union from becoming a necessity. Thats why Chinas rise is so important. It sets the stage for a great historical drama, one that will feature scenes in Lisbon, Shanghai and everywhere in between. And this time, Europe wont be able to rely on the U.S. being ready to sweep in with a deus ex machina. Even as China with its unrivaled economic and technological dynamism starts to look like a much greater threat to Europeans than the Soviet Union ever did, Washington does not seem to have either the capacity or the willingness to reprise its role from the Cold War. As in the famous play by Pirandello, European nations can be seen as a series of characters in search of an author. That search may be over. In China, they have found the external force that can bring them together. Bruno Maes, a former Europe minister for Portugal, is a senior adviser at Flint Global in London and a nonresident senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington. His book The Dawn of Eurasia was published by Penguin last year. Also On POLITICO ",
        "The author, Bruno Macaes, is an unusually astute observer with his own book \"Dawn of Eurasia\" that covers this topic at length.  He's from Portugal, a smaller recovering economy with a lot at stake in the health of EU.\nI find his Twitter feed very informative on this topic, and European policy makers would do well to heed his advice.",
        "There is an old diplomatic saying, \"Russia is never as strong as it looks and Russia is never as weak as it looks\".  China is the same.<p>China is a large, poor country with an aging population.  It is a badly run dictatorship that is more likely to return to warlordism than become a world power.<p>Australia and Canada are the primary targets for Chinese interference. Both are used for money laundering.  Uncle Xi is destroying the little political legitimacy from growing the economy.  The social credit system will further undermine the ability of China to move from a source of cheap labour to a more advanced economy.<p>China 2020 = Japan 1985."
