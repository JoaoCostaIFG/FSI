If a plant is already drought-stressed, an eclipse might be bad news, like losing 14 percent of a days income when youre already broke, Mr. Beverly said.Their findings follow a few other studies, including one done during an eclipse over Europe in 1999 that showed changes in sap flow and transpiration in a beech tree near Ghent, Belgium. The tree held its breath during the solar eclipse, said Kathy Steppe, now a professor of plant ecology at Ghent University meaning it stopped releasing water, even as its sap kept flowing.Mr. Beverly looks forward to the 2024 eclipse, which will sweep from Mexico through to the Eastern United States, when he plans to take a closer look at crop and tree responses.Hell do one thing differently: I would try to use as much automation as possible so I could actually enjoy the eclipse, he said.

Tue, 16 Jul 19 / 01:32 Dear Shirin & Arun, Place Flight M British Standard Time Indian Standard Time Duration Distance A/C Speed Alt London BA 119 D Tue, 16 Jul / 14:25 (+01:00) Tue, 16 Jul / 18:55 (+05:30) B 777 Bengaluru A Wed, 17 Jul / 00:05 (+01:00) Wed, 17 Jul / 04:35 (+05:30) 09:40 hr 8,010 km 869 km/h 11,280 mt On Wed, 17 Jul, a Partial Lunar Eclipse begins at (all IST) 01:31:43, reaches Maximum 65% at 03:00:44 and Ends at 04:29:39. You will be landing in Bengaluru, at 04:35; just 5 minutes after the Eclipse ends. Solar Eclipses are Virtual. They really do not exist. They are Localised OUR Views of the sun, from an individual on the earth. They are no different from holding an umbrella over your head, when walking under the sun. Instead of the umbrella, you are \"holding\"the moon over your head, blocking the sun, only to you, locally; only about 30 km around you. It is about 30 km radius circle, because your umbrella is about 1 mt diametre and the moon's diametre is 3,476 km; but then, it is 362,600 km to 405,600 km away. Lunar Eclipses are real. They are actually happening of an event on the moon. The earth's shadow, is actually falling on the moon. All the persons in half earth who can see the moon, can see the Eclipse, in the same manner. When you take off from London, set your watch 04 hr 30 mt head. In that watch, when it isIndia's time, 01:31:43 (correct to the second), the Eclipse begins. You can calibrate your watch, correct to the second. Please try to get a seat on the right side, so that you can get a view on the West side. Do not sit over the wing. When the Eclipse starts at 01:32, you will be over Oman (wave to Arun's sister Anita). From Oman to Bengaluru, you willfly due South-East. You do not have to crane your neck. See the moon at level, straight through your window. This is a rare opportunity, to see the entire Lunar Eclipse of 02 hr 57 mt 56 sc through the window of a plane. Take your BEST binoculars with you. If you do not have one, purchase it in Belfast or London. At 11.28 km high, above the atmosphere, your moon sight will be in crystal clear sky. As the Earth's sharply edged shadow races across the moon's surface, at about 1,000 km per hour, through your binoculars, you will see the edge of the shadow climbing up the moon's mountains and dipping below into the valleys. From the Earth's surface, the moon appears flat. In reality, the centre of the moon is 1,738 km nearer to you. From a plane, at 11 km above the Earth's surface, as the Earth's shadow's edge races across the moon's surface, your eyes will suddenly see the moon in 3 dimensions. Just intently stare at the moon. Your brain will suddenly pop up the moon into 3 dimensions. This is a million pounds worth ofexperience, which you can NEVER have fromthe Earth's surface. Looking forward to meeting you.

I wish I was on that flight :)I saw one error in your mail. The eclipse will happen in the eastern sky. So they should get a view on the \"East side of the plane\".Also, they can inform the crew so that the crew informs the other passengers. All the best to them. Hope they get to witness a wonderful eclipse (and may be take a photo from the cockpit).Thanks and Regards,Keerthi -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. keerthi kiranunread,Jul 16, 2019, 7:51:22 AM7/16/19to BASHi Bhu1 Lord,The mail (although written in a personal context) is informational. Also, it is a good read :)Regards,Keerthi -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. Message has been deletedSusam Palunread,Jul 16, 2019, 8:15:54 AM7/16/19to Bangalore Astronomical SocietyThe eclipse would begin at 01:32 AM IST, i.e., 00:02 AM GST at Oman when the plane is likely flying over Oman. In Muscat (Oman), the moon would rise at 06:39 PM GST in the East-southeast, cross the local meridian at 12:09 AM GST, and set at 05:40 AM GST in the West-southwest [1]. Therefore, when the eclipse would start at 00:02 AM GST, the moon would be in the eastern sky close to the local meridian at Muscat.But then most of the remaining eclipse seems to take place in the western sky. For example, in Bangalore, the moon would rise at 06:30 PM IST in the East-southeast, cross the local meridian at 12:20 AM IST, and set at 06:10 AM IST in the West-southwest [2]. Therefore, when the eclipse would end at 04:29 AM IST, the moon would be in the western sky ready to set in about 1.5 hours. It looks like most of the eclipse would indeed be visible in the western sky from this particular flight.[1]: https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/oman/muscat[2]: https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/india/bangaloreThanks,Susam -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group.Shashikiran Kolarunread,Jul 16, 2019, 2:50:55 PM7/16/19to Bangalore Astronomical SocietyYes, as Susam says, with respect to Muscat and India, the Moon spends most of its time in the Western half of the sky when it enters the Earth's umbral shadow.Muscat is 22, or about 90 minutes, West of Bangalore. So, if the partial eclipse begins at 1.30AM here, it would do so at 12.00AM at Muscat. Since this is the full moon, it's in opposition and hence transits to Western part of the sky at (local) 12.00AM. Also, the plane would be flying Eastwards, causing the Moon would always hang in the Western part of the sky thereon.That lunar eclipses always begin at the Eastern limb of the Moon was perhaps confused with the Moon being in the Eastern half of the sky?As an aside, it is likely that certain depictions on temples indicate eclipses. In the attached picture, a snake is seen moving towards a moon (shown as a crescentto perhaps distinguish it from the Sun) and likely indicates Rahu/Ketu about to swallow the Moon causing a lunar eclipse. The temple may have been dedicated during such an event.Thanks,-ShashiRameshwara temple, Hale Palya, Hassan District, Karnataka.JPGBHU1 LORDunread,Jul 16, 2019, 2:56:15 PM7/16/19to b-...@googlegroups.comI guess I misunderstood the mail when I first read it as it was written in personal context and thought it was meant to be sent to somebody personallyBut I really appreciate the result especially regarding the accurate timings mentioned in the mailI'm eagerly waiting for the eclipse and wish all of you clear skieskeerthi kiranunread,Jul 17, 2019, 10:08:39 AM7/17/19to BASHi Susam, Shashikiran,You guys are right.

This image of the Lunar eclipse was shot at 02:52 AM (I.S.T.) on 17 July, using the 14inch telescope and Hyperstar lens. Location - Tijara, Rajasthan.This image is a HDR composite of 5 images, clicked in quick succession, and varying exposures. The longer exposure was good for the darker portion of the eclipse, and the shorter exposure was good for the brighter part of the Moon, which was not inside the umbra. The 5 images were combined to show the brighter as well as the darker portions of this partial lunar eclipse together in an HDR image. Monsoon clouds can be seen all around the eclipsed moon.Ajay Talwar -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group.2019-07-17 Partial Lunar Eclipse Hyperstar HDR.jpgBHU1 LORDunread,Jul 17, 2019, 11:05:55 AM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comThis picture is worth all the effort you put into itI like how to incorporated the clouds into the picture, it gives kind of a mysterious feel to itkeerthi kiranunread,Jul 17, 2019, 12:58:22 PM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comHere are some good photos clicked by Prabhu Kutti, Naveen and Niranjan from our WhatsApp group.Regards,Keerthikeerthi kiranunread,Jul 17, 2019, 12:59:50 PM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comAwesome image Ajay :)But don't share it with TV channels, they will use it will special effects to scare people... :D Huligun .comunread,Jul 17, 2019, 6:46:28 PM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comGood photos all, thanks for sharing !!!

Tue, 16 Jul 19 / 01:32 Dear Shirin & Arun, Place Flight M British Standard Time Indian Standard Time Duration Distance A/C Speed Alt London BA 119 D Tue, 16 Jul / 14:25 (+01:00) Tue, 16 Jul / 18:55 (+05:30) B 777 Bengaluru A Wed, 17 Jul / 00:05 (+01:00) Wed, 17 Jul / 04:35 (+05:30) 09:40 hr 8,010 km 869 km/h 11,280 mt On Wed, 17 Jul, a Partial Lunar Eclipse begins at (all IST) 01:31:43, reaches Maximum 65% at 03:00:44 and Ends at 04:29:39. You will be landing in Bengaluru, at 04:35; just 5 minutes after the Eclipse ends. Solar Eclipses are Virtual. They really do not exist. They are Localised OUR Views of the sun, from an individual on the earth. They are no different from holding an umbrella over your head, when walking under the sun. Instead of the umbrella, you are \"holding\"the moon over your head, blocking the sun, only to you, locally; only about 30 km around you. It is about 30 km radius circle, because your umbrella is about 1 mt diametre and the moon's diametre is 3,476 km; but then, it is 362,600 km to 405,600 km away. Lunar Eclipses are real. They are actually happening of an event on the moon. The earth's shadow, is actually falling on the moon. All the persons in half earth who can see the moon, can see the Eclipse, in the same manner. When you take off from London, set your watch 04 hr 30 mt head. In that watch, when it isIndia's time, 01:31:43 (correct to the second), the Eclipse begins. You can calibrate your watch, correct to the second. Please try to get a seat on the right side, so that you can get a view on the West side. Do not sit over the wing. When the Eclipse starts at 01:32, you will be over Oman (wave to Arun's sister Anita). From Oman to Bengaluru, you willfly due South-East. You do not have to crane your neck. See the moon at level, straight through your window. This is a rare opportunity, to see the entire Lunar Eclipse of 02 hr 57 mt 56 sc through the window of a plane. Take your BEST binoculars with you. If you do not have one, purchase it in Belfast or London. At 11.28 km high, above the atmosphere, your moon sight will be in crystal clear sky. As the Earth's sharply edged shadow races across the moon's surface, at about 1,000 km per hour, through your binoculars, you will see the edge of the shadow climbing up the moon's mountains and dipping below into the valleys. From the Earth's surface, the moon appears flat. In reality, the centre of the moon is 1,738 km nearer to you. From a plane, at 11 km above the Earth's surface, as the Earth's shadow's edge races across the moon's surface, your eyes will suddenly see the moon in 3 dimensions. Just intently stare at the moon. Your brain will suddenly pop up the moon into 3 dimensions. This is a million pounds worth ofexperience, which you can NEVER have fromthe Earth's surface. Looking forward to meeting you.

I wish I was on that flight :)I saw one error in your mail. The eclipse will happen in the eastern sky. So they should get a view on the \"East side of the plane\".Also, they can inform the crew so that the crew informs the other passengers. All the best to them. Hope they get to witness a wonderful eclipse (and may be take a photo from the cockpit).Thanks and Regards,Keerthi -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. keerthi kiranunread,Jul 16, 2019, 7:51:22 AM7/16/19to BASHi Bhu1 Lord,The mail (although written in a personal context) is informational.

In Muscat (Oman), the moon would rise at 06:39 PM GST in the East-southeast, cross the local meridian at 12:09 AM GST, and set at 05:40 AM GST in the West-southwest [1]. Therefore, when the eclipse would start at 00:02 AM GST, the moon would be in the eastern sky close to the local meridian at Muscat.But then most of the remaining eclipse seems to take place in the western sky. For example, in Bangalore, the moon would rise at 06:30 PM IST in the East-southeast, cross the local meridian at 12:20 AM IST, and set at 06:10 AM IST in the West-southwest [2]. Therefore, when the eclipse would end at 04:29 AM IST, the moon would be in the western sky ready to set in about 1.5 hours. It looks like most of the eclipse would indeed be visible in the western sky from this particular flight.[1]: https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/oman/muscat[2]: https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/india/bangaloreThanks,Susam -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group.Shashikiran Kolarunread,Jul 16, 2019, 2:50:55 PM7/16/19to Bangalore Astronomical SocietyYes, as Susam says, with respect to Muscat and India, the Moon spends most of its time in the Western half of the sky when it enters the Earth's umbral shadow.Muscat is 22, or about 90 minutes, West of Bangalore. So, if the partial eclipse begins at 1.30AM here, it would do so at 12.00AM at Muscat. Since this is the full moon, it's in opposition and hence transits to Western part of the sky at (local) 12.00AM. Also, the plane would be flying Eastwards, causing the Moon would always hang in the Western part of the sky thereon.That lunar eclipses always begin at the Eastern limb of the Moon was perhaps confused with the Moon being in the Eastern half of the sky?As an aside, it is likely that certain depictions on temples indicate eclipses. In the attached picture, a snake is seen moving towards a moon (shown as a crescentto perhaps distinguish it from the Sun) and likely indicates Rahu/Ketu about to swallow the Moon causing a lunar eclipse. The temple may have been dedicated during such an event.Thanks,-ShashiRameshwara temple, Hale Palya, Hassan District, Karnataka.JPGBHU1 LORDunread,Jul 16, 2019, 2:56:15 PM7/16/19to b-...@googlegroups.comI guess I misunderstood the mail when I first read it as it was written in personal context and thought it was meant to be sent to somebody personallyBut I really appreciate the result especially regarding the accurate timings mentioned in the mailI'm eagerly waiting for the eclipse and wish all of you clear skieskeerthi kiranunread,Jul 17, 2019, 10:08:39 AM7/17/19to BASHi Susam, Shashikiran,You guys are right.

This image of the Lunar eclipse was shot at 02:52 AM (I.S.T.) on 17 July, using the 14inch telescope and Hyperstar lens. Location - Tijara, Rajasthan.This image is a HDR composite of 5 images, clicked in quick succession, and varying exposures. The longer exposure was good for the darker portion of the eclipse, and the shorter exposure was good for the brighter part of the Moon, which was not inside the umbra. The 5 images were combined to show the brighter as well as the darker portions of this partial lunar eclipse together in an HDR image. Monsoon clouds can be seen all around the eclipsed moon.Ajay Talwar -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group. -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group.2019-07-17 Partial Lunar Eclipse Hyperstar HDR.jpgBHU1 LORDunread,Jul 17, 2019, 11:05:55 AM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comThis picture is worth all the effort you put into itI like how to incorporated the clouds into the picture, it gives kind of a mysterious feel to itkeerthi kiranunread,Jul 17, 2019, 12:58:22 PM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comHere are some good photos clicked by Prabhu Kutti, Naveen and Niranjan from our WhatsApp group.Regards,Keerthikeerthi kiranunread,Jul 17, 2019, 12:59:50 PM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comAwesome image Ajay :)But don't share it with TV channels, they will use it will special effects to scare people... :D Huligun .comunread,Jul 17, 2019, 6:46:28 PM7/17/19to b-...@googlegroups.comGood photos all, thanks for sharing !!!

          "LETTERS Decoding the ancient Greek astronomical calculator known as the Antikythera Mechanism T. Freeth 1,2 , Y. Bitsakis 3,5 , X. Moussas 3 , J. H. Seiradakis 4 , A. Tselikas 5 , H. Mangou 6 , M. Zafeiropoulou 6 , R. Hadland 7 , D. Bate 7 , A. Ramsey 7 , M. Allen 7 , A. Crawley 7 , P. Hockley 7 , T. Malzbender 8 , D. Gelb 8 , W. Ambrisco 9 & M. G. Edmunds 1 The Antikythera Mechanism is a unique Greek geared device, con- structed around the end of the second century BC. It is known 19 that it calculated and displayed celestial information, particularly cycles such as the phases of the moon and a luni-solar calendar. Calendars were important to ancient societies 10 for timing agricul- tural activity and fixing religious festivals. Eclipses and planetary motions were often interpreted as omens, while the calm regular- ity of the astronomical cycles must have been philosophically attractive in an uncertain and violent world. Named after its place of discovery in 1901 in a Roman shipwreck, the Antikythera Mechanism is technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards. Its specific functions have remained controversial 1114 because its gears and the inscriptions upon its faces are only fragmentary. Here we report surface imaging and high-resolution X-ray tomography of the surviving fragments, enabling us to reconstruct the gear function and double the number of deciphered inscriptions. The mechanism predicted lunar and solar eclipses on the basis of Babylonian arithmetic- progression cycles. The inscriptions support suggestions of mech- anical display of planetary positions 9,14,15 , now lost. In the second century BC, Hipparchos developed a theory to explain the irregu- larities of the Moons motion across the sky caused by its elliptic orbit. We find a mechanical realization of this theory in the gear- ing of the mechanism, revealing an unexpected degree of technical sophistication for the period. The bronze mechanism (Fig. 1), probably hand-driven, was ori- ginally housed in a wooden-framed case 1 of (uncertain) overall size 315 3 190 3 100 mm (Fig. 2). It had front and back doors, with astronomical inscriptions covering much of the exterior of the mech- anism. Our new transcriptions and translations of the Greek texts are given in Supplementary Note 2 (glyphs and inscriptions). The detailed form of the lettering can be dated to the second half of the second century BC, implying that the mechanism was constructed during the period 150100 BC, slightly earlier than previously sug- gested 1 . This is consistent with a date of around 8060 BC for the wreck 1,16 from which the mechanism was recovered by some of the first underwater archaeology. We are able to complete the recon- struction 1 of the back door inscription with text from fragment E, and characters from fragments A and F (see Fig. 1 legend for fragment nomenclature). The front door is mainly from fragment G. The text is astronomical, with many numbers that could be related to planetary motions; the word sterigmos (STGRICMOS, translated as sta- tion or stationary point) is found, meaning where a planets appar- ent motion changes direction, and the numbers may relate to planetary cycles. We note that a major aim of this investigation is to set up a data archive to allow non-invasive future research, and access to this will start in 2007. Details will be available on www.an- tikythera-mechanism.gr. The back door inscription mixes mechanical terms about con- struction (trunnions, gnomon, perforations) with astronom- ical periods. Of the periods, 223 is the Saros eclipse cycle (see Box 1 for a brief explanation of astronomical cycles and periods).

Figure 1 | The surviving fragments of the Antikythera Mechanism. The 82 fragments that survive in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens are shown to scale. A key and dimensions are provided in Supplementary Note 1 (fragments). The major fragments A, B, C, D are across the top, starting at top left, with E, F, G immediately below them. 27 hand-cut bronze gears are in fragment A and one gear in each of fragments B, C and D. Segments of display scales are in fragments B, C, E and F. A schematic reconstruction is given in Fig. 2. It is not certain that every one of the remaining fragments (numbered 175) belong to the mechanism. The distinctive fragment A, which contains most of the gears, is approximately 180 3 150 mm in size. We have used three principal techniques to investigate the structure and inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism. (1) Three-dimensional X-ray microfocus computed tomography 24 (CT), developed by X-Tek Systems Ltd. The use of CT has been crucial in making the text legible just beneath the current surfaces. (2) Digital optical imaging to reveal faint surface detail using polynomial texture mapping (PTM) 25,26 , developed by Hewlett- Packard Inc. (3) Digitized high-quality conventional film photography.

The references to golden little sphere and little sphere probably refer to the front zodiac display for the Sun and Moonincluding phase for the latter. The text near the lower back dial includes Pharos and from south (about/around).Spain (ISPANIA) ten. These geograph- ical references, together with previous readings 1 of towards the east, west-north-west and west-south-west suggest an eclipse function for the dial, as solar eclipses occur only at limited geograph- ical sites, and winds were often recorded 1719 in antiquity with eclipse observations. Possibly this information was added to the mechanism during use. Turning to the dials themselves, the front dial displays the position of the Sun and Moon in the zodiac, and a corresponding calendar 1 of 365 days that could be adjusted for leap years. Previously 1 , it was suggested that the upper back dial might have five concentric rings with 47 divisions per turn, showing the 235 months of the 19-year Metonic cycle. A later proposal 5 augments this with the upper sub- sidiary dial showing the 76-year Callippic cycle. Our optical and X-ray microfocus computed tomography (CT) imaging confirms these proposals, with 34 scale markings discovered on the upper back dial. On the basis of a statistical analysis analogous to that described for gear tooth counts below, we confirm the 235 total divisions. We also find from the CT that the subsidiary dial is indeed divided into quadrants 1,6 , as required for a Callippic dial. In agreement with the back door inscription, we also substantiate the perceptive proposal 5,20 that the dial is in fact a spiral, made from semicircular arcs displaced Figure 2 | A schematic view of the mechanism to illustrate the position of major inscriptions and dials. The front dial has two concentric scales. The inner scale shows the Greek zodiac with 360 divisions. There are occasional Greek letters denoting references to the Parapegma inscription, and we add three further reference letters (Z, H, H) to Prices description 1 . The Parapegma is a star almanac showing rising and settings at dawn or evening of particular stars or constellations, which we will discuss elsewhere. Its form is consistent with a date of late second century BC. The outer (originally) movable scale is a calendar carrying the Egyptian names of the months with Greek letters. The Egyptian calendar of 365 days, with twelve 30-day months and 5 extra (epagomenai) days was in standard use in Greek astronomy. The effect of the extra quarter day in a year could be corrected by turning the scale one day every four yearsand a sequence of holes to take a locking pin is observed under the scale. We find that spacing of the holes is indeed what would be expected for a total of 365 days, with a possible range 363365. The position of the Sun and Moon would have been indicated by pointers across the dial scales, and a device 7 showing the phase of the Moon was probably carried round on the lunar pointer. It is not clear whether the Sun position pointer would have been separated from a date pointer, or whether any planetary positions might have been displayed. The spiral upper back dial displays the luni-solar Metonic sequence of 235 lunar months with a subsidiary dial showing the Callippic cycle, while the spiral lower back dial displays the 223-lunar-month Saros eclipse cycle with a subsidiary dial showing the Exeligmos cycle. Box 1 | Astronomical cycles known to the Babylonians The lunar (or synodic) month is the interval between the Moon being at the same phasefor example, full moon to full moon. The Metonic cycle results from the close equality of 19 years to 235 lunar months. It represents the return to the same phase of the Moon on the same date in the year. After the cycle, the Sun, Moon and Earth are back in nearly the same relative orientations. The Moon appears to return to the same point in the sky relative to the zodiac in a sidereal month, and in 19 years there are 235 1 19 5 254 sidereal months. The 76-year Callippic cycle is four Metonic cycles minus one dayand improves the accuracy of reconciling solar years with whole numbers of lunar months. The Saros is an eclipse repeat cycle. If either a solar or lunar eclipse occurs, a very similar eclipse will occur 223 lunar months later 23 .A record of past eclipses can thus be used to predict future occurrences. The cycle arises from the coincidence of three orbital periods of the Moon. These are: (1) same phase to same phase, 223 synodic monthseclipses will of course only occur at new or full Moon in the month; (2) the lunar crossing of the Earth Sun orbital plane, 242 draconitic monthseclipses can only occur near these points (nodes) of co-alignment; (3) similar Earth Moon distances which occur on the period from apogee to apogee of the Moons orbit, 239 anomalistic months. The distance will determine the magnitude of the eclipse, ensuring the similarity of eclipses at the period of the cycle. The Saros cycle is not an integer number of days (6,585M), causing the eclipses in successive cycles to be displaced by eight hours in time (and solar eclipses, only visible at limited geographical locations, to be displaced by 120u in longitude). True repeats come after 3 Saros cycles, the 54-year Exeligmos cycle, but not with identical solar eclipse paths. LETTERS NATURE | Vol 444 | 30 November 2006 588 Natu re Pu blishin g Gro u p 2 0 0 6 to two centres on the vertical midline. In the CT of fragment B we find a new feature that explains why the dial is a spiral: a pointer-follower device (Fig. 3) travelled around the spiral groove to indicate which month (across the five turns of the scale) should be read. From our CT data of the 48 scale divisions observed in fragments A, E and F, we establish 223 divisions in the four-turn 5,20 spiral on the lower back dial, the spiral starting at the bottom of the dial. This is the Saros eclipse cycle, whose number is on the back door inscription. The 54-year Exeligmos cycle of three Saros cycles is shown on the lower subsidiary dial. Between the scale divisions of the Saros dial we have identified 16 blocks of characters, or glyphs (see Supplementary Note 2 (glyphs and inscriptions)) at intervals of one, five and six months. These are eclipse predictions and contain either S for a lunar eclipse (from SELGNG, Moon) or G for a solar eclipse (from GLIOS, Sun) or both. A correlation analysis (analogous to DNA sequence matching) with historic eclipse data 21 (all modern eclipse data and predictions in our work are from this reference) indicates that over a period of 400 1 BC, the sequence of eclipses marked by the identified glyphs would be exactly matched by 121 possible start dates. The matching only occurs if the lunar month starts at first crescent, and confirms this choice of month start in the mechanism. The sequences of eclipses can then be used to predict the expected position of glyphs on the whole dial, as seen in Fig. 4. The dial starts and finishes with an eclipse. Although Ptolemy indicates that the Greeks recorded eclipses in the second century BC, the Babylonian Saros canon 1719 is the only known source of sufficient data to construct the dial. The functions of the mechanism are determined by the tooth counts of the gears. These are based mainly on the CT, using angular measurement from a nominal centre to the remains of tooth tips. In a few cases all teeth can be seen, but many gears are incomplete. Counts are established by fitting models with regularly spaced teeth and minimising the r.m.s. deviation from the measurementsvarying the centre in software (when unclear) to find the best-fit solution or solutions (see Supplementary Note 3 (gears)). We have adopted a systematic nomenclature of lower case letters for the axis of the gear, with numbering increasing with ordering from the front of the mech- anism. Hypothetical (lost) gears are denoted by italics. Several models have been proposed for the gear trains 1,2,46,8 . We agree with the assumption of four missing gears (n1, n2, p1, p2) to drive the Metonic and Callippic dials 4 . We propose a new reconstruc- tion for the other trains, which uses all extant gears (except the lone r1 0 1 2 3 4 5 cm Figure 4 | Reconstruction of the back dials. A composite of fragments A, B, E and F. The Metonic calendar is at top, with its subsidiary Callippic dial. The Saros eclipse cycle is below, with its subsidiary Exeligmos dial. The 16 observed eclipse glyphs are shown in turquoise on the Saros dial, with 35 hypothetical glyphs in violet. The hypothetical glyphs are based on the criterion that 99% of the 121 sequences exactly matching the observed glyphs have an eclipse at the month position. Both main dials would have a pointer-follower (see Fig. 3) to indicate the relevant lunar month on the spiral. The monthly divisions on the Metonic upper back dial are not simply scribed directly across all five turns, as might be expected for simplicity of construction. There are small misalignments, implying a systematic attempt at marking full (30-day) and hollow (29-day) months. The incomplete data do not allow good analysis, other than a hint of bimodality in the interval distribution. If the marking out of the scale were carried out using the mechanisms gearing, then this would greatly pre-date known dividing engines 27 by many centuries. Figure 3 | The pointer-follower lunar month indicator of the upper back dial. On the left, false-colour sections through CT images, analysed with VGStudio Max software by Volume Graphics GmbH. These show two views at right angles of the pointer-follower in the Metonic dial in fragment B. On the right, a computer reconstruction of the device from two different angles (with the Metonic scale omitted for clarity). The pin was constrained to follow the groove between the spiral scales (the scale is shown in Fig. 4), causing the device to slide along the month pointer to indicate which ring on the spiral scale specified the month. A similar pointer-follower would have been present on the lower back (Saros) dial. The Metonic dial would have required re- setting every 19 years, the Saros dial after 18 years. The groove-pin may have been held in place by the small pin through the front of the device, enabling its removal for re-setting. NATURE | Vol 444 | 30 November 2006 LETTERS 589 Natu re Pu blishin g Gro u p 2 0 0 6 from the separate fragment D). The proposed model is shown in Fig. 5. We require the assumption of only one further gear (m3), whose proposed shaft is clearly broken off in the CT. A detailed description is contained in Supplementary Note 3 (gears). Of particular note is the dual use of the large gear, e3, at the back of the mechanism, which has found no use in previous models. In our model, it is powered by m3 as part of a fixed-axis train that turns the Saros and Exeligmos dials for eclipse prediction, and also doubles as the epicyclic table for the gears k1, k2. These are part of epicyclic gearing that calculates the theory of the irregular motion of the moon, developed by Hipparchos some time between 146 and 128 BC (ref. 22)the first anomaly, caused by its elliptical orbit about the Earth. The period of this anomaly is the period from apogee to apogee (the anomalistic month). To realize this theory, the mean sidereal lunar motion is first calculated by gears on axes c, d and e and this is then fed into the epicyclic system. As explained in Fig. 6, a pin- and-slot device on the epicyclic gears k1 and k2, clearly seen in the CT, provides the variation. This was previously identified 4 , but rejected as a lunar mechanism. The remarkable purpose of mounting the pin-and-slot mechanism on the gear e3 is to change the period of variation from sidereal month (that is, the time taken for the Moon to orbit the Earth relative to the zodiac), which would occur if k1 and k2 were on fixed axes, to anomalistic monthby carrying the gears epicyclically at a rate that is the difference between the rates of the Front dials Lunar phase Lost epicyclic gearing Pin and slot Hipparchos lunar mechanism Possibly Hipparchos solar mechanism and planetary mechanisms Hipparchos sidereal month Year Back dials Luni-solar calendar Input Eclipse prediction Saros 4Metonic 5Callippic Exeligmos Zodiac Egyptian calendar Parapegma Figure 5 | New reconstruction of the gear trains. A schematic sectional diagram (not to scale) of the gearing, following the style of Price 1 and Wright 4 . The viewpoint is looking down from the top right of the mechanism, and is stretched in the direction of the main axes to show the structure. Features that are outlined or labelled in red are hypothetical. Gears are lettered with their shaft, and numbered with increasing distance from the front dial. The two-or-three digit number on the gear is its actual or assumed tooth count (see Supplementary Note 3 (gears)). Hypothetical gears n1, n2, p1, p2 have been proposed previously, the gear m3 on the broken-off shaft m is our addition. All gears, except the lone one in fragment D, are now accounted for in the mechanism. The function of the trains is outlined in the text. We find no evidence in the CT for an idler wheel carried on e3 and between e5 and k1 or between k2 and e6, as has been previously proposed 1,2,4 . The CT shows a pin through axis e between gears e1 and e2. We believe its purpose is to retain the square-bossed e1 on the shaft, but its passage right through the axis rules out previous reconstructions 1,2,4 where e1 and e2 were joined by an outer pipe rotating around the shaft e. Figure 6 | The Hipparchos lunar mechanism mounted on gear e3. The figure is based on a CT slice of part of fragment A, showing (top) shaft e and (bottom) shaft k. The complete geometry cannot be seen in a single CT slice. The two gears on the e axis (e5 and e6) are coaxial, while the two k gears rotate on slightly displaced axes. k1 has a pin on its face that engages with a radial slot in k2 (and this was previously reported 5 ). In the figure the pitch circles of e5 and k1 are shown in turquoise and those of e6 and k2 in pink. The gear e5 drives k1, which drives k2 via the pin-and-slot, introducing a quasi-sinusoidal variation in the motion, which is then transmitted to e6. Our estimate of the distance between the arbors on the k gears is about 1.1 mm, with a pin distance of 9.6 mm, giving an angular variation of 6.5u. According to Ptolemy 28 , Hipparchos made two estimates for a lunar anomaly parameter, based on eclipse data, which would require angular variations of 5.9u or 4.5u herealthough estimates of the anomaly from Babylonian astronomy were generally larger. The difference from our estimated value is probably not significant given the difficulty of precise measurement of the axes in the CT. The harmonic variation, together with the effect of carrying the gears on e3 (which rotates at the period of the Moons apogee around the Earth), would simulate the correct variation for the Moons mean (sidereal) rotation rate on the front dial. An (unexplained) regular pentagon is visible at the centre of gear e5. It is tempting to associate the conception of the mechanism with Hipparchos himself, but he was not the first to assume eccentric or epicyclic models.

Gears with 53 teeth are awkward to divide. So it may seem sur- prising that the gearing includes two such gears (f1, l2), whose effects cancel in the train leading to the Saros dial. But the gearing has been specifically designed so that the epicyclic table e3 turns at the rate of rotation of the Moons apogeethe factor 53 being derived from the calculation of this rotation from the Metonic and Saros cycles, which are the bases for all the prime factors in the tooth counts of the gears. The establishment of the 53-tooth count of these gears is powerful confirmation of our proposed model of Hipparchos lunar theory. The output of this complex system is carried from e6 back through e3 and thence, via e1 and b3, to the zodiac scale on the front dial and the lunar phase 7 mechanism. Our CT confirms the complex structure of axis e that this model entails. The Antikythera Mechanism shows great economy and ingenuity of design. It stands as a witness to the extraordinary technological potential of Ancient Greece, apparently lost within the Roman Empire. Received 10 August; accepted 17 October 2006. 1. Price, D. de S.

Edmunds 1 The Antikythera Mechanism is a unique Greek geared device, con- structed around the end of the second century BC. It is known 19 that it calculated and displayed celestial information, particularly cycles such as the phases of the moon and a luni-solar calendar. Calendars were important to ancient societies 10 for timing agricul- tural activity and fixing religious festivals. Eclipses and planetary motions were often interpreted as omens, while the calm regular- ity of the astronomical cycles must have been philosophically attractive in an uncertain and violent world. Named after its place of discovery in 1901 in a Roman shipwreck, the Antikythera Mechanism is technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards. Its specific functions have remained controversial 1114 because its gears and the inscriptions upon its faces are only fragmentary. Here we report surface imaging and high-resolution X-ray tomography of the surviving fragments, enabling us to reconstruct the gear function and double the number of deciphered inscriptions. The mechanism predicted lunar and solar eclipses on the basis of Babylonian arithmetic- progression cycles. The inscriptions support suggestions of mech- anical display of planetary positions 9,14,15 , now lost. In the second century BC, Hipparchos developed a theory to explain the irregu- larities of the Moons motion across the sky caused by its elliptic orbit. We find a mechanical realization of this theory in the gear- ing of the mechanism, revealing an unexpected degree of technical sophistication for the period. The bronze mechanism (Fig. 1), probably hand-driven, was ori- ginally housed in a wooden-framed case 1 of (uncertain) overall size 315 3 190 3 100 mm (Fig. 2). It had front and back doors, with astronomical inscriptions covering much of the exterior of the mech- anism. Our new transcriptions and translations of the Greek texts are given in Supplementary Note 2 (glyphs and inscriptions). The detailed form of the lettering can be dated to the second half of the second century BC, implying that the mechanism was constructed during the period 150100 BC, slightly earlier than previously sug- gested 1 . This is consistent with a date of around 8060 BC for the wreck 1,16 from which the mechanism was recovered by some of the first underwater archaeology. We are able to complete the recon- struction 1 of the back door inscription with text from fragment E, and characters from fragments A and F (see Fig. 1 legend for fragment nomenclature). The front door is mainly from fragment G. The text is astronomical, with many numbers that could be related to planetary motions; the word sterigmos (STGRICMOS, translated as sta- tion or stationary point) is found, meaning where a planets appar- ent motion changes direction, and the numbers may relate to planetary cycles. We note that a major aim of this investigation is to set up a data archive to allow non-invasive future research, and access to this will start in 2007. Details will be available on www.an- tikythera-mechanism.gr. The back door inscription mixes mechanical terms about con- struction (trunnions, gnomon, perforations) with astronom- ical periods. Of the periods, 223 is the Saros eclipse cycle (see Box 1 for a brief explanation of astronomical cycles and periods). We discover the inscription spiral divided into 235 sections, which is 1 Cardiff University, School of Physics and Astronomy, Queens Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff CF24 3AA, UK. 2 Images First Ltd, 10 Hereford Road, South Ealing, London W5 4SE, UK. 3 National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Department of Astrophysics, Astronomy and Mechanics, Panepistimiopolis, GR-15783, Zographos, G reece. 4 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Department of Physics, Section of Astrophysics, Astronomy and Mechanics, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece. 5 Centre for History and Palaeography, National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation, P.

Figure 1 | The surviving fragments of the Antikythera Mechanism. The 82 fragments that survive in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens are shown to scale. A key and dimensions are provided in Supplementary Note 1 (fragments). The major fragments A, B, C, D are across the top, starting at top left, with E, F, G immediately below them. 27 hand-cut bronze gears are in fragment A and one gear in each of fragments B, C and D. Segments of display scales are in fragments B, C, E and F. A schematic reconstruction is given in Fig. 2. It is not certain that every one of the remaining fragments (numbered 175) belong to the mechanism. The distinctive fragment A, which contains most of the gears, is approximately 180 3 150 mm in size. We have used three principal techniques to investigate the structure and inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism. (1) Three-dimensional X-ray microfocus computed tomography 24 (CT), developed by X-Tek Systems Ltd. The use of CT has been crucial in making the text legible just beneath the current surfaces. (2) Digital optical imaging to reveal faint surface detail using polynomial texture mapping (PTM) 25,26 , developed by Hewlett- Packard Inc. (3) Digitized high-quality conventional film photography.

The references to golden little sphere and little sphere probably refer to the front zodiac display for the Sun and Moonincluding phase for the latter. The text near the lower back dial includes Pharos and from south (about/around).Spain (ISPANIA) ten. These geograph- ical references, together with previous readings 1 of towards the east, west-north-west and west-south-west suggest an eclipse function for the dial, as solar eclipses occur only at limited geograph- ical sites, and winds were often recorded 1719 in antiquity with eclipse observations. Possibly this information was added to the mechanism during use. Turning to the dials themselves, the front dial displays the position of the Sun and Moon in the zodiac, and a corresponding calendar 1 of 365 days that could be adjusted for leap years. Previously 1 , it was suggested that the upper back dial might have five concentric rings with 47 divisions per turn, showing the 235 months of the 19-year Metonic cycle. A later proposal 5 augments this with the upper sub- sidiary dial showing the 76-year Callippic cycle. Our optical and X-ray microfocus computed tomography (CT) imaging confirms these proposals, with 34 scale markings discovered on the upper back dial. On the basis of a statistical analysis analogous to that described for gear tooth counts below, we confirm the 235 total divisions. We also find from the CT that the subsidiary dial is indeed divided into quadrants 1,6 , as required for a Callippic dial. In agreement with the back door inscription, we also substantiate the perceptive proposal 5,20 that the dial is in fact a spiral, made from semicircular arcs displaced Figure 2 | A schematic view of the mechanism to illustrate the position of major inscriptions and dials. The front dial has two concentric scales. The inner scale shows the Greek zodiac with 360 divisions. There are occasional Greek letters denoting references to the Parapegma inscription, and we add three further reference letters (Z, H, H) to Prices description 1 . The Parapegma is a star almanac showing rising and settings at dawn or evening of particular stars or constellations, which we will discuss elsewhere. Its form is consistent with a date of late second century BC. The outer (originally) movable scale is a calendar carrying the Egyptian names of the months with Greek letters. The Egyptian calendar of 365 days, with twelve 30-day months and 5 extra (epagomenai) days was in standard use in Greek astronomy. The effect of the extra quarter day in a year could be corrected by turning the scale one day every four yearsand a sequence of holes to take a locking pin is observed under the scale. We find that spacing of the holes is indeed what would be expected for a total of 365 days, with a possible range 363365. The position of the Sun and Moon would have been indicated by pointers across the dial scales, and a device 7 showing the phase of the Moon was probably carried round on the lunar pointer. It is not clear whether the Sun position pointer would have been separated from a date pointer, or whether any planetary positions might have been displayed. The spiral upper back dial displays the luni-solar Metonic sequence of 235 lunar months with a subsidiary dial showing the Callippic cycle, while the spiral lower back dial displays the 223-lunar-month Saros eclipse cycle with a subsidiary dial showing the Exeligmos cycle. Box 1 | Astronomical cycles known to the Babylonians The lunar (or synodic) month is the interval between the Moon being at the same phasefor example, full moon to full moon. The Metonic cycle results from the close equality of 19 years to 235 lunar months. It represents the return to the same phase of the Moon on the same date in the year. After the cycle, the Sun, Moon and Earth are back in nearly the same relative orientations. The Moon appears to return to the same point in the sky relative to the zodiac in a sidereal month, and in 19 years there are 235 1 19 5 254 sidereal months. The 76-year Callippic cycle is four Metonic cycles minus one dayand improves the accuracy of reconciling solar years with whole numbers of lunar months. The Saros is an eclipse repeat cycle. If either a solar or lunar eclipse occurs, a very similar eclipse will occur 223 lunar months later 23 .A record of past eclipses can thus be used to predict future occurrences. The cycle arises from the coincidence of three orbital periods of the Moon. These are: (1) same phase to same phase, 223 synodic monthseclipses will of course only occur at new or full Moon in the month; (2) the lunar crossing of the Earth Sun orbital plane, 242 draconitic monthseclipses can only occur near these points (nodes) of co-alignment; (3) similar Earth Moon distances which occur on the period from apogee to apogee of the Moons orbit, 239 anomalistic months. The distance will determine the magnitude of the eclipse, ensuring the similarity of eclipses at the period of the cycle. The Saros cycle is not an integer number of days (6,585M), causing the eclipses in successive cycles to be displaced by eight hours in time (and solar eclipses, only visible at limited geographical locations, to be displaced by 120u in longitude). True repeats come after 3 Saros cycles, the 54-year Exeligmos cycle, but not with identical solar eclipse paths. LETTERS NATURE | Vol 444 | 30 November 2006 588 Natu re Pu blishin g Gro u p 2 0 0 6 to two centres on the vertical midline. In the CT of fragment B we find a new feature that explains why the dial is a spiral: a pointer-follower device (Fig. 3) travelled around the spiral groove to indicate which month (across the five turns of the scale) should be read. From our CT data of the 48 scale divisions observed in fragments A, E and F, we establish 223 divisions in the four-turn 5,20 spiral on the lower back dial, the spiral starting at the bottom of the dial. This is the Saros eclipse cycle, whose number is on the back door inscription. The 54-year Exeligmos cycle of three Saros cycles is shown on the lower subsidiary dial. Between the scale divisions of the Saros dial we have identified 16 blocks of characters, or glyphs (see Supplementary Note 2 (glyphs and inscriptions)) at intervals of one, five and six months. These are eclipse predictions and contain either S for a lunar eclipse (from SELGNG, Moon) or G for a solar eclipse (from GLIOS, Sun) or both. A correlation analysis (analogous to DNA sequence matching) with historic eclipse data 21 (all modern eclipse data and predictions in our work are from this reference) indicates that over a period of 400 1 BC, the sequence of eclipses marked by the identified glyphs would be exactly matched by 121 possible start dates. The matching only occurs if the lunar month starts at first crescent, and confirms this choice of month start in the mechanism. The sequences of eclipses can then be used to predict the expected position of glyphs on the whole dial, as seen in Fig. 4. The dial starts and finishes with an eclipse. Although Ptolemy indicates that the Greeks recorded eclipses in the second century BC, the Babylonian Saros canon 1719 is the only known source of sufficient data to construct the dial. The functions of the mechanism are determined by the tooth counts of the gears. These are based mainly on the CT, using angular measurement from a nominal centre to the remains of tooth tips. In a few cases all teeth can be seen, but many gears are incomplete. Counts are established by fitting models with regularly spaced teeth and minimising the r.m.s. deviation from the measurementsvarying the centre in software (when unclear) to find the best-fit solution or solutions (see Supplementary Note 3 (gears)). We have adopted a systematic nomenclature of lower case letters for the axis of the gear, with numbering increasing with ordering from the front of the mech- anism. Hypothetical (lost) gears are denoted by italics. Several models have been proposed for the gear trains 1,2,46,8 . We agree with the assumption of four missing gears (n1, n2, p1, p2) to drive the Metonic and Callippic dials 4 . We propose a new reconstruc- tion for the other trains, which uses all extant gears (except the lone r1 0 1 2 3 4 5 cm Figure 4 | Reconstruction of the back dials. A composite of fragments A, B, E and F. The Metonic calendar is at top, with its subsidiary Callippic dial. The Saros eclipse cycle is below, with its subsidiary Exeligmos dial. The 16 observed eclipse glyphs are shown in turquoise on the Saros dial, with 35 hypothetical glyphs in violet. The hypothetical glyphs are based on the criterion that 99% of the 121 sequences exactly matching the observed glyphs have an eclipse at the month position. Both main dials would have a pointer-follower (see Fig. 3) to indicate the relevant lunar month on the spiral. The monthly divisions on the Metonic upper back dial are not simply scribed directly across all five turns, as might be expected for simplicity of construction. There are small misalignments, implying a systematic attempt at marking full (30-day) and hollow (29-day) months. The incomplete data do not allow good analysis, other than a hint of bimodality in the interval distribution. If the marking out of the scale were carried out using the mechanisms gearing, then this would greatly pre-date known dividing engines 27 by many centuries. Figure 3 | The pointer-follower lunar month indicator of the upper back dial. On the left, false-colour sections through CT images, analysed with VGStudio Max software by Volume Graphics GmbH. These show two views at right angles of the pointer-follower in the Metonic dial in fragment B. On the right, a computer reconstruction of the device from two different angles (with the Metonic scale omitted for clarity). The pin was constrained to follow the groove between the spiral scales (the scale is shown in Fig. 4), causing the device to slide along the month pointer to indicate which ring on the spiral scale specified the month. A similar pointer-follower would have been present on the lower back (Saros) dial. The Metonic dial would have required re- setting every 19 years, the Saros dial after 18 years. The groove-pin may have been held in place by the small pin through the front of the device, enabling its removal for re-setting. NATURE | Vol 444 | 30 November 2006 LETTERS 589 Natu re Pu blishin g Gro u p 2 0 0 6 from the separate fragment D). The proposed model is shown in Fig. 5. We require the assumption of only one further gear (m3), whose proposed shaft is clearly broken off in the CT. A detailed description is contained in Supplementary Note 3 (gears). Of particular note is the dual use of the large gear, e3, at the back of the mechanism, which has found no use in previous models. In our model, it is powered by m3 as part of a fixed-axis train that turns the Saros and Exeligmos dials for eclipse prediction, and also doubles as the epicyclic table for the gears k1, k2. These are part of epicyclic gearing that calculates the theory of the irregular motion of the moon, developed by Hipparchos some time between 146 and 128 BC (ref. 22)the first anomaly, caused by its elliptical orbit about the Earth. The period of this anomaly is the period from apogee to apogee (the anomalistic month). To realize this theory, the mean sidereal lunar motion is first calculated by gears on axes c, d and e and this is then fed into the epicyclic system. As explained in Fig. 6, a pin- and-slot device on the epicyclic gears k1 and k2, clearly seen in the CT, provides the variation. This was previously identified 4 , but rejected as a lunar mechanism. The remarkable purpose of mounting the pin-and-slot mechanism on the gear e3 is to change the period of variation from sidereal month (that is, the time taken for the Moon to orbit the Earth relative to the zodiac), which would occur if k1 and k2 were on fixed axes, to anomalistic monthby carrying the gears epicyclically at a rate that is the difference between the rates of the Front dials Lunar phase Lost epicyclic gearing Pin and slot Hipparchos lunar mechanism Possibly Hipparchos solar mechanism and planetary mechanisms Hipparchos sidereal month Year Back dials Luni-solar calendar Input Eclipse prediction Saros 4Metonic 5Callippic Exeligmos Zodiac Egyptian calendar Parapegma Figure 5 | New reconstruction of the gear trains. A schematic sectional diagram (not to scale) of the gearing, following the style of Price 1 and Wright 4 . The viewpoint is looking down from the top right of the mechanism, and is stretched in the direction of the main axes to show the structure. Features that are outlined or labelled in red are hypothetical. Gears are lettered with their shaft, and numbered with increasing distance from the front dial. The two-or-three digit number on the gear is its actual or assumed tooth count (see Supplementary Note 3 (gears)). Hypothetical gears n1, n2, p1, p2 have been proposed previously, the gear m3 on the broken-off shaft m is our addition. All gears, except the lone one in fragment D, are now accounted for in the mechanism. The function of the trains is outlined in the text. We find no evidence in the CT for an idler wheel carried on e3 and between e5 and k1 or between k2 and e6, as has been previously proposed 1,2,4 . The CT shows a pin through axis e between gears e1 and e2. We believe its purpose is to retain the square-bossed e1 on the shaft, but its passage right through the axis rules out previous reconstructions 1,2,4 where e1 and e2 were joined by an outer pipe rotating around the shaft e. Figure 6 | The Hipparchos lunar mechanism mounted on gear e3. The figure is based on a CT slice of part of fragment A, showing (top) shaft e and (bottom) shaft k. The complete geometry cannot be seen in a single CT slice. The two gears on the e axis (e5 and e6) are coaxial, while the two k gears rotate on slightly displaced axes. k1 has a pin on its face that engages with a radial slot in k2 (and this was previously reported 5 ). In the figure the pitch circles of e5 and k1 are shown in turquoise and those of e6 and k2 in pink. The gear e5 drives k1, which drives k2 via the pin-and-slot, introducing a quasi-sinusoidal variation in the motion, which is then transmitted to e6. Our estimate of the distance between the arbors on the k gears is about 1.1 mm, with a pin distance of 9.6 mm, giving an angular variation of 6.5u. According to Ptolemy 28 , Hipparchos made two estimates for a lunar anomaly parameter, based on eclipse data, which would require angular variations of 5.9u or 4.5u herealthough estimates of the anomaly from Babylonian astronomy were generally larger. The difference from our estimated value is probably not significant given the difficulty of precise measurement of the axes in the CT. The harmonic variation, together with the effect of carrying the gears on e3 (which rotates at the period of the Moons apogee around the Earth), would simulate the correct variation for the Moons mean (sidereal) rotation rate on the front dial. An (unexplained) regular pentagon is visible at the centre of gear e5. It is tempting to associate the conception of the mechanism with Hipparchos himself, but he was not the first to assume eccentric or epicyclic models.

Gears with 53 teeth are awkward to divide. So it may seem sur- prising that the gearing includes two such gears (f1, l2), whose effects cancel in the train leading to the Saros dial. But the gearing has been specifically designed so that the epicyclic table e3 turns at the rate of rotation of the Moons apogeethe factor 53 being derived from the calculation of this rotation from the Metonic and Saros cycles, which are the bases for all the prime factors in the tooth counts of the gears. The establishment of the 53-tooth count of these gears is powerful confirmation of our proposed model of Hipparchos lunar theory. The output of this complex system is carried from e6 back through e3 and thence, via e1 and b3, to the zodiac scale on the front dial and the lunar phase 7 mechanism. Our CT confirms the complex structure of axis e that this model entails. The Antikythera Mechanism shows great economy and ingenuity of design. It stands as a witness to the extraordinary technological potential of Ancient Greece, apparently lost within the Roman Empire. Received 10 August; accepted 17 October 2006. 1. Price, D. de S.

Workplace uses windows, so the usual dance of installing the jdk, setting the env variables, creating a project in eclipse and for some reason it uses the jre instead of the jdk. Some plugins/packages such as lombok work in eclipse but not in vs code! And even in eclipse there's some annotation (@Data I think) that's supposed to generate getters and setters but it doesn't work.<p>- Flexible architecture : some use service, serviceimpl and controllers. Some skip the service interface. And it turns out you can extend crudrepository and have a fully functioning rest endpoint without writing any code using spring data rest!<p>- Magic : this is incredibly frustrating. Some repository types are automatically exported, some are not and the docs do an atrocious job of explaing what's going on. Place some file abc.xyz in the root and magic happens!<p>- Docs : the single worst part of learning spring boot, especially for newcomers. How can the docs possibly be so insensitive to newcomers? Or do they expect only experienced devs at big cos to use spring boot?<p>- I hate to admit this, but I still don't know what a god damn bean is, what AOP is, what inversion of control is.<p>This was mainly a rant and a bad one at that, but I had to vent.",

It tends to be selected for its popularity which means there are StackOverflow answers, pretty good support for common use cases, and a large pool to hire from.<p>At the same time, Spring Boot (or even just Spring) aren't the worst once you get used to them. I myself have come to dislike other aspects of it (e.g. slow startup, JPQL and Hibernate quirks, excessive gc, poor scaling). Most of these things probably won't have much of an impact until the application gets to a certain level of complexity or scale. But if it wasn't about solving for the future, Ruby or Python would be better to start.",

Learning to setup a Windows machine for Java development is difficult if you aren't familiar with environment variables and the like.<p>Java, like C++, has gotten more and more features/keywords over the years. Frameworks like Spring Boot tend to make use of those features. Also, Spring Boot is a sit down and read the guides compared to something like Rails or ExpressJS and the like. Depending on your Java knowledge the documentation is going to be hit or miss I think. Also, convention over configuration makes it harder for new developers to get the hang of developing with a framework like Spring Boot because they don't know the conventions usually."

Workplace uses windows, so the usual dance of installing the jdk, setting the env variables, creating a project in eclipse and for some reason it uses the jre instead of the jdk. Some plugins/packages such as lombok work in eclipse but not in vs code! And even in eclipse there's some annotation (@Data I think) that's supposed to generate getters and setters but it doesn't work.<p>- Flexible architecture : some use service, serviceimpl and controllers. Some skip the service interface. And it turns out you can extend crudrepository and have a fully functioning rest endpoint without writing any code using spring data rest!<p>- Magic : this is incredibly frustrating. Some repository types are automatically exported, some are not and the docs do an atrocious job of explaing what's going on. Place some file abc.xyz in the root and magic happens!<p>- Docs : the single worst part of learning spring boot, especially for newcomers. How can the docs possibly be so insensitive to newcomers? Or do they expect only experienced devs at big cos to use spring boot?<p>- I hate to admit this, but I still don't know what a god damn bean is, what AOP is, what inversion of control is.<p>This was mainly a rant and a bad one at that, but I had to vent.",

It tends to be selected for its popularity which means there are StackOverflow answers, pretty good support for common use cases, and a large pool to hire from.<p>At the same time, Spring Boot (or even just Spring) aren't the worst once you get used to them. I myself have come to dislike other aspects of it (e.g. slow startup, JPQL and Hibernate quirks, excessive gc, poor scaling).

Depending on your Java knowledge the documentation is going to be hit or miss I think. Also, convention over configuration makes it harder for new developers to get the hang of developing with a framework like Spring Boot because they don't know the conventions usually."

          "Anaxagoras, who lived in the fifth century B.C., was one of the first people in recorded history to recognize that the moon was a rocky, mountainous body. Eduard Lebiedzki / Public Domain Close to the north pole of the moon lies the crater Anaxagoras, named for a Greek philosopher who lived in the fifth century B.C. The eponym is fitting, as Anaxagoras the man was one of the first people in history to suggest the moon was a rocky body, not all too dissimilar from Earth. Streaks of material thrown out during the impact that formed the crater extend 560 miles southward to the rim of another crater, this one named for Plato. Like Plato, Anaxagoras the scholar did most of his work in Athens, but the similarities between the two men stop there. Influenced strongly by the Pythagoreans, Plato posited a mystical universe based on sacred geometric forms, including perfectly circular orbits. Plato eschewed observation and experimentation, preferring to pursue a pure knowledge he believed was innate in all humans. But Anaxagoras, who died around the time Plato was born, had a knack for astronomy, an area of study that requires careful observational and calculation to unlock the mysteries of the universe. During his time in Athens, Anaxagoras made several fundamental discoveries about the moon. He reiterated and expended upon an idea that likely emerged among his predecessors but was not widely accepted in antiquity: that the moon and sun were not gods, but rather objects. This seemingly innocuous belief would ultimately result in Anaxagoras arrest and exile. Anaxagoras crater near the north pole of the moon, imaged by the Lunar Orbiter 4 spacecraft in 1967. NASA Piecing together the lives of early philosophers such as Anaxagoras, who is thought to have written just one book, lost to us today, can be a major challenge for historians. Modern scholars have only fragments to describe the life of Anaxagorasbrief quotes from his teachings and short summaries of his ideas, cited within the works of scholars from later generations, such as Plato and Aristotle. Through persistent observation, Anaxagoras came to believe that the moon was a rock, not totally unlike the Earth, and he even described mountains on the lunar surface. The sun, he thought, was a burning rock. In fragment 18, Anaxagoras says, It is the sun that puts brightness into the moon. While Anaxagoras was not the first to realize that moonlight is reflected light from the sun, he was able to use this concept to correctly explain additional natural phenomena, such as eclipses and lunar phases. Hailing from Clazomenae in the Ionian lands east of the Greek mainland, Anaxagoras grew up during the Ionian Enlightenment, an intellectual revolution that began around 600 B.C. As a young man, he saw Athens and Sparta align to drive the Persian Empire out of Ionia. When he relocated to Athens, Anaxagoras and his contemporaries brought philosophy to the budding Athenian democracy. Although many Greek philosophers of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. believed in one or a few fundamental elementssuch as water, air, fire and earthAnaxagoras thought there must be an infinite number of elements. This idea was his way of resolving an intellectual dispute concerning the nature of existence that had emerged between the naturalistic-minded philosophers of Ionia to the east and the mystical-minded philosophers to the west, in Greek-colonized Italy, such as Pythagoras and his followers. Daniel Graham, a professor of philosophy at Brigham Young University and one of the few Anaxagoras experts in the world, says that of the Italian-based philosophers, Parmenides in particular influenced Anaxagoras and his ideas about astronomy. Anaxagoras turns the problem of lunar light into a problem of geometry, Graham says. He noted that when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth than the sun, the full face is illuminated, [producing] a model of the heavens that predicts not only phases of the moon, but how eclipses are possible. The moons phases, Anaxagoras realized, were the result of different portions of the celestial object being illuminated by the sun from Earths perspective. The philosopher also realized that the occasional darkening of the moon must result from the moon, sun and Earth lining up such that the moon passes into the Earths shadowa lunar eclipse. When the moon passes directly in front of the sun, the skies darken during the day, a phenomenon Anaxagoras also described and we now call a solar eclipse. The total lunar eclipse of October 8, 2014, as photographed from California. When the shadow of the Earth covers the moon, only light filtered through Earth's atmosphere reaches the lunar surface, casting the moon in a reddish glow. Alfredo Garcia, Jr. / Flickr under CC BY-SA 2.0 Anaxagoras also wrestled with the origins and formation of the moon, a mystery that still challenges scientists today. The philosopher proposed that the moon was a big rock which the early Earth had flung into space. This concept anticipated a scenario for the moons origin that physicist George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, would propose 23 centuries later. Known as the fission hypothesis, Darwins idea was that the moon began as a chunk of Earth and was hurled into space by the Earths rapid rotation, leaving behind the Pacific basin. (Today, many astronomers believe that a Mars-sized body slammed into the early Earth, expelling material that then coalesced into the moon, though other theories exist for the origin of our natural satellite.) By describing the moon as a rock of terrestrial origin, and the sun as a burning rock, Anaxagoras moved beyond earlier thinkers, even those who realized the moon was a kind of reflector. This forward thinking got Anaxagoras labeled as a chief denier of the idea that the moon and sun were deities. Such an idea should have been welcome in democratic Athens, but Anaxagoras was a teacher and friend of the influential statesman Pericles, and political factions would soon conspire against him. In power for over 30 years, Pericles would lead Athens into the Peloponnesian wars against Sparta. While the exact causes of these conflicts are a matter of debate, Pericles political opponents in the years leading to the wars blamed him for excessive aggression and arrogance. Unable to hurt the Athenian leader directly, Pericles enemies went after his friends. Anaxagoras was arrested, tried and sentenced to death, ostensibly for breaking impiety laws while promoting his ideas about the moon and sun. In the Athenian democracy, with its democratic trials before large juries on criminal charges being brought by private citizensthere was no district attorneyall trials were basically political trials, Graham says. They were often disguised as being about religion or morality, but they aimed at embarrassing some public figure by going after him directly if he was vulnerable, or a member of his circle if he was not. If you wanted to attack Pericles, but he was too popular to attack directly, you found the weakest link in his group. As a foreigner and intellectual with unorthodox new ideas, Pericles friend and science advisor Anaxagoras was an obvious target. Still holding some political sway, Pericles was able to free Anaxagoras and prevent his execution. Though his life was spared, the philosopher who questioned the divinity of the moon found himself in exile in Lampsacus at the edge of the Hellespont. But his ideas regarding eclipses and lunar phases would live on to this day, and for his recognition of the true nature of the moon, a lunar crater, visited by orbiting spacecraft some 2,400 years later, bears the name Anaxagoras.

          "Something about IR Optimization",
          "https://brrt-to-the-future.blogspot.com/2019/03/something-about-ir-optimization.html",
          "Hi hackers! Today I want to write about optimizing IR in the MoarVM JIT, and also a little bit about IR design itself. One of the (major) design goals for the expression JIT was to have the ability to optimize code over the boundaries of individual MoarVM instructions. To enable this, the expression JIT first expands each VM instruction into a graph of lower-level operators. Optimization then means pattern-matching those graphs and replacing them with more efficient expressions. As a running example, consider the idx operator. This operator takes two inputs (base and element) and a constant parameter scale and computes base+element*scale. This represents one of the operands of an 'indexed load' instruction on x86, typically used to process arrays. Such instructions allow one instruction to be used for what would otherwise be two operations (computing an address and loading a value). However, if the element of the idx operator is a constant, we can replace it instead with the addr instruction, which just adds a constant to a pointer. This is an improvement over idx because we no longer need to load the value of element into a register. This saves both an instruction and valuable register space. Unfortunately this optimization introduces a bug. (Or, depending on your point of view, brings an existing bug out into the open). The expression JIT code generation process selects instructions for subtrees (tile) of the graph in a bottom-up fashion. These instructions represent the value computed or work performed by that subgraph. (For instance, a tree like(load (addr ? 8) 8) becomes mov ?, qword [?+8]; the question marks are filled in during register allocation). Because an instruction is always represents a tree, and because the graph is an arbitrary directed acyclic graph, the code generator projects that graph as a tree by visiting each operator node only once. So each value is computed once, and that computed value is reused by all later references. It is worth going into some detail into why the expression graph is not a tree. Aside from transformations that might be introduced by optimizations (e.g. common subexpression elimination), a template may introduce a value that has multiple references via the let: pseudo-operator. See for instance the following (simplified) template: (let: (($foo (load (local)))) (add $foo (sub $foo (const 1)))) Both ADD and SUB refer to the same LOAD node In this case, both references to $foo point directly to the sameload operator. Thus, the graph is not a tree. Another case in which this occurs is during linking of templates into the graph. The output of an instruction is used, if possible, directly as the input for another instruction. (This is the primary way that the expression JIT can get rid of unnecessary memory operations). But there can be multiple instructions that use a value, in which case an operator can have multiple references. Finally, instruction operands are inserted by the compiler and these can have multiple references as well. If each operator is visited only once during code generation, then this may introduce a problem when combined with another feature - conditional expressions. For instance, if two branches of a conditional expression both refer to the same value (represented by name $foo) then the code generator will only emit code to compute its value when it encounters the firstreference. When the code generator encounters $foo for the second time in the other branch, no code will be emitted.This means that in the second branch, $foo will effectively have no defined value (because the code in the first branch is never executed), and wrong values or memory corruption is then the predictable result. This bug has always existed for as long as the expression JIT has been under development, and in the past the solution has been not to write templates which have this problem. This is made a little easier by a feature the let: operator, in that it inserts a do operator which orders the values that are declared to be computed before the code that references them. So that this is in fact non-buggy: (let: (($foo (load (local))) # code to compute $foo is emitted here (if (...) (add $foo (const 1)) # $foo is just a reference (sub $foo (const 2)) # and here as well The DO node is inserted for the LET operator. It ensures that the value of the LOAD node is computed before the reference in either branch Alternatively, if a value $foo is used in the condition of the if operator, you can also be sure that it is available in both sides of the condition. All these methods rely on the programmer being able to predict when a value will be first referenced and hence evaluated. An optimizer breaks this by design. This means that if I want the JIT optimizer to be successful, my options are: Fix the optimizer so as to not remove references that are critical for the correctness of the program Modify the input tree so that such references are either copied or moved forward Fix the code generator to emit code for a value, if it determines that an earlier reference is not available from the current block. In other words, I first need to decide where this bug really belongs - in the optimizer, the code generator, or even the IR structure itself. The weakness of the expression IR is that expressions don't really impose a particular order. (This is unlike the spesh IR, which is instruction-based, and in which every instruction has a 'previous' and 'next' pointer). Thus, there really isn't a 'first' reference to a value, before the code generator introduces the concept. This is property is in fact quite handy for optimization (for instance, we can evaluate operands in whatever order is best, rather than being fixed by the input order) - so I'd really like to preserve it. But it also means that the property we're interested in - a value is computed before it is used in, in all possible code flow paths - isn't really expressible by the IR. And there is no obvious local invariantthat can be maintained to ensure that this bug does not happen, so any correctness check may have to check the entire graph, which is quite impractical. I hope this post explains why this is such a tricky problem! I have some ideas for how to get out of this, but I'll reserve those for a later post, since this one has gotten quite long enough.

        "url_text": "Hi hackers! Today I want to write about optimizing IR in the MoarVM JIT, and also a little bit about IR design itself. One of the (major) design goals for the expression JIT was to have the ability to optimize code over the boundaries of individual MoarVM instructions. To enable this, the expression JIT first expands each VM instruction into a graph of lower-level operators. Optimization then means pattern-matching those graphs and replacing them with more efficient expressions. As a running example, consider the idx operator. This operator takes two inputs (base and element) and a constant parameter scale and computes base+element*scale. This represents one of the operands of an 'indexed load' instruction on x86, typically used to process arrays. Such instructions allow one instruction to be used for what would otherwise be two operations (computing an address and loading a value). However, if the element of the idx operator is a constant, we can replace it instead with the addr instruction, which just adds a constant to a pointer. This is an improvement over idx because we no longer need to load the value of element into a register. This saves both an instruction and valuable register space. Unfortunately this optimization introduces a bug. (Or, depending on your point of view, brings an existing bug out into the open). The expression JIT code generation process selects instructions for subtrees (tile) of the graph in a bottom-up fashion. These instructions represent the value computed or work performed by that subgraph. (For instance, a tree like(load (addr ? 8) 8) becomes mov ?, qword [?+8]; the question marks are filled in during register allocation). Because an instruction is always represents a tree, and because the graph is an arbitrary directed acyclic graph, the code generator projects that graph as a tree by visiting each operator node only once. So each value is computed once, and that computed value is reused by all later references. It is worth going into some detail into why the expression graph is not a tree. Aside from transformations that might be introduced by optimizations (e.g. common subexpression elimination), a template may introduce a value that has multiple references via the let: pseudo-operator. See for instance the following (simplified) template: (let: (($foo (load (local)))) (add $foo (sub $foo (const 1)))) Both ADD and SUB refer to the same LOAD node In this case, both references to $foo point directly to the sameload operator. Thus, the graph is not a tree. Another case in which this occurs is during linking of templates into the graph. The output of an instruction is used, if possible, directly as the input for another instruction. (This is the primary way that the expression JIT can get rid of unnecessary memory operations). But there can be multiple instructions that use a value, in which case an operator can have multiple references. Finally, instruction operands are inserted by the compiler and these can have multiple references as well. If each operator is visited only once during code generation, then this may introduce a problem when combined with another feature - conditional expressions. For instance, if two branches of a conditional expression both refer to the same value (represented by name $foo) then the code generator will only emit code to compute its value when it encounters the firstreference.

          "Advisory ID: NFLX-2019-002 Title: HTTP/2 Denial of Service Advisory Release Date: 2019-08-13 Severity: High Overview: Netflix has discovered several resource exhaustion vectors affecting a variety of third-party HTTP/2 implementations. These attack vectors can be used to launch DoS attacks against servers that support HTTP/2 communication. Netflix worked with Google and CERT/CC to coordinate disclosure to the Internet community. Today, a number of vendors have announced patches to correct this suboptimal behavior. While we havent detected these vulnerabilities in our open source packages, we are issuing this security advisory to document our findings and to further assist the Internet security community in remediating these issues. Impact: There are three broad areas of information security: confidentiality (information cant be read by unauthorized people), integrity (information cant be changed by unauthorized people), and availability (information and systems are available when you want them). All of the changes announced today are in the availability category. These HTTP/2 vulnerabilities do not allow an attacker to leak or modify information. Rather, they allow a small number of low bandwidth malicious sessions to prevent connection participants from doing additional work. These attacks are likely to exhaust resources such that other connections or processes on the same machine may also be impacted or crash. The Weaknesses: HTTP/2 (defined in RFCs 7540 and 7541) represents a significant change from HTTP/1.1. There are several new capabilities, including header compression and multiplexing of data from multiple streams, which make this attractive to the user community. To support these new features, HTTP/2 has grown to encompass some of the complexity of a Layer 3 transport protocol: Data is now carried in binary frames; There are both per-connection and per-stream windows that define how much data can be sent; There are several ICMP-like control messages (ping, reset, and settings frames, for example) which operate at the HTTP/2 connection layer; and, This is a fairly robust concept of stream prioritization. While this added complexity enables some exciting new features, it also raises implementation questions. When implementations run on the internet and are exposed to malicious users, implementers may wonder: Should I limit any of the control messages? How do I implement the priority queueing scheme in a computationally efficient way? How do I implement the flow-control algorithms in a computationally efficient way? How could an attacker manipulate the flow-control algorithm at the HTTP/2 layer to cause unintended results? (And, can they manipulate the flow-control algorithms at both the HTTP/2 and TCP layers together to cause unintended results?) The Security Considerations section of RFC 7540 (see Section 10.5) addresses some of this in a general way. However, unlike the expected normal behaviorwhich is well-documented and which implementations seem to follow very closelythe algorithms and mechanisms for detecting and mitigating abnormal behavior are significantly more vague and left as an exercise for the implementer. From a review of various software packages, it appears that this has led to a variety of implementations with a variety of good ideas, but also some weaknesses. Why does this matter? Most of these attacks work at the HTTP/2 transport layer. As illustrated in the diagram below, this layer sits above the TLS transport, but below the concept of a request. In fact, many of these attacks involve either 0 or 1 requests. Since the early days of HTTP, tooling has been oriented around requests: logs often indicate requests (rather than connections); rate-limiting may occur at the request level; and, traffic controls may be triggered by requests. By contrast, there is not as much tooling that looks at HTTP/2 connections to log, rate-limit, and trigger remediation based on a clients behavior at the HTTP/2 connection layer. Therefore, organizations may find it more difficult to discover and block malicious HTTP/2 connections and may need to add additional tooling to handle these situations. These attack vectors allow a remote attacker to consume excessive system resources. Some are efficient enough that a single end-system could potentially cause havoc on multiple servers. Other attacks are less efficient; however, even less efficient attacks can open the door for DDoS attacks which are difficult to detect and block. Attacks Many of the attack vectors we found (and which were fixed today) are variants on a theme: a malicious client asks the server to do something which generates a response, but the client refuses to read the response. This exercises the servers queue management code. Depending on how the server handles its queues, the client can force it to consume excess memory and CPU while processing its requests. These are the attacks which are being disclosed today, all discovered by Jonathan Looney of Netflix, except for CVE-2019-9518 which was discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google: CVE-2019-9511 Data Dribble: The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9512 Ping Flood: The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9513 Resource Loop: The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9514 Reset Flood: The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9515 Settings Flood: The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9516 0-Length Headers Leak: The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9517 Internal Data Buffering: The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9518 Empty Frames Flood: The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. (Discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google) Workarounds and Fixes In most cases, an immediate workaround is to disable HTTP/2 support. However, this may cause performance degradation, and it might not be possible in all cases. To obtain software fixes, please contact your software vendor. More information can also be found in the CERT/CC vulnerability note. ",

This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra extension components and/or scripts using Java or Python. In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and generating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential vulnerabilities in networks and systems. If you are a U.S. citizen interested in projects like this, to develop Ghidra and other cybersecurity tools for NSA to help protect our nation and its allies, consider applying for a career with us. Install To install an official pre-built multi-platform Ghidra release: Install JDK 11 64-bit Download a Ghidra release file Extract the Ghidra release file Launch Ghidra: ./ghidraRun (or ghidraRun.bat for Windows) For additional information and troubleshooting tips about installing and running a Ghidra release, please refer to docs/InstallationGuide.html which can be found in your extracted Ghidra release directory. Build To create the latest development build for your platform from this source repository: Install build tools: JDK 11 64-bit Gradle 6 or 7 make, gcc, and g++ (Linux/macOS-only) Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows-only) Download and extract the source: Download from GitHub $ unzip ghidra-master $ cd ghidra-master NOTE: Instead of downloading the compressed source, you may instead want to clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra.git Download additional build dependencies into source repository: $ gradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle init Create development build: The compressed development build will be located at build/dist/. For more detailed information on building Ghidra, please read the Developer Guide. Develop User Scripts and Extensions Ghidra installations support users writing custom scripts and extensions via the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse. The plugin and its corresponding instructions can be found within a Ghidra release at Extensions/Eclipse/GhidraDev/. Advanced Development To develop the Ghidra tool itself, it is highly recommended to use Eclipse, which the Ghidra development process has been highly customized for.

When I tried to observe it again mid June, it didn't meet the predicted time and path. It turned out to have maneuvered to another orbit. Thanks to the amateur satellite observers-network, it was rapidly found in orbit again and I was able to take some images on June 30 and July 2. This most recent pass was almost overhead. The OTV is a small version of the classic Space Shuttle, it is really a small object, even at only 300 km altitude, so don't expect the detail level of ground based images of the real Space Shuttle. Considering this, the attached images succeeded beyond expectations. We can recognize a bit of the nose, Payload Bay and tail of this mini-shuttle with even a sign of some smaller detail. Images were taken through a 10 inch F/4,8 aperture Newtonian telescope with an Astrolumina ALccd 5L-11 mono CMOS camera. Tracking was fully manually through a 6x30 finderscope.

Photo Illustration: Dave Cole/WSJ; Photo: Michael Kovac/Getty Images for WeWork Sept. 18, 2019 12:23 pm ET Adam Neumann was flying high. Literally. His office-rental giant WeWork was months away from being valued at $47 billion. Revenue was doubling annually. And Mr. Neumann was zipping across the Atlantic Ocean in a Gulfstream G650 private jet with friends last summer, smoking marijuana.

          "Can't say that this is surprising, given the startup types I have worked with in the past.<p>[EDIT]\nI want to elaborate on this, actually. Rewards are good incentives until they become so large that they eclipse the value of the thing one is working on. At that point, you no longer attract people who want to accomplish things for their own sake or who even think they know how. With a large enough reward, what you attract are assholes who want rewards.<p>I hope we figure this problem out before people like this drive our whole civilization/planet off a cliff because they want to be rich. You'd think it would be obvious, and I think it is to many of us. But there are enough of these reward seekers and the rewards are big enough that they dominate the scene.",

          "Can't say that this is surprising, given the startup types I have worked with in the past.<p>[EDIT]\nI want to elaborate on this, actually. Rewards are good incentives until they become so large that they eclipse the value of the thing one is working on. At that point, you no longer attract people who want to accomplish things for their own sake or who even think they know how. With a large enough reward, what you attract are assholes who want rewards.<p>I hope we figure this problem out before people like this drive our whole civilization/planet off a cliff because they want to be rich. You'd think it would be obvious, and I think it is to many of us. But there are enough of these reward seekers and the rewards are big enough that they dominate the scene.",

          "Credit: Queens University Belfast The sun's magnetic field is ten times stronger than previously believed, new research from Queen's University Belfast and Aberystwyth University has revealed. The new finding was discovered by Dr. David Kuridze, Research Fellow at Aberystwyth University. Dr. Kuridze began the research when he was based at Queen's University Belfast and completed it when he moved to Aberystwyth University in 2017. He is a leading authority on the use of ground-based telescopes to study the sun's corona, the ring of bright light visible during a total eclipse. Working from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma in the Canary Islands, Dr. Kuridze studied a particularly strong solar flare which erupted near the surface of the sun on 10 September 2017. A combination of favourable conditions and an element of luck enabled the team to determine the strength of the flare's magnetic field with unprecedented accuracy. The researchers believe the findings have the potential to change our understanding of the processes that happen in the sun's immediate atmosphere. Speaking about the find, Dr. Kuridze said: \"Everything that happens in the sun's outer atmosphere is dominated by the magnetic field, but we have very few measurements of its strength and spatial characteristics. \"These are critical parameters, the most important for the physics of the solar corona. It is a little like trying to understand the Earth's climate without being able to measure its temperature at various geographical locations. \"This is the first time we have been able to measure accurately the magnetic field of the coronal loops, the building blocks of the sun's magnetic corona, which such a level of accuracy.\" Measuring 1,400,000 kilometres across (109 times larger than Earth) and 150,000,000 kilometres from Earth, the sun's corona extends millions of kilometres above the surface. Solar flares appear as bright flashes and occur when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Until now, successful measurement of the magnetic field has been hindered by the weakness of the signal from the sun's atmosphere that reaches Earth and caries information about the magnetic field, and limitations in the instrumentation available. The magnetic fields reported in this study are similar to those of a typical fridge magnet and around 100 times weaker than the magnetic field encountered in an MRI scanner. However, they are still responsible for the confinement of the solar plasma, which make up solar flares, as far as 20,000 km above the sun's surface. Over a 10-day period in September 2017, Dr. Kuridze studied an active area on the sun's surface which the team knew to be particularly volatile. However, the telescope used can only focus on 1% of the sun's surface at any given time. As luck would have it, Dr. Kuridze was focused on exactly the right area and at the right time when the solar flare erupted. These solar flares can lead to storms which, if they hit Earth, form the northern lights the Aurora Borealis. They can also disrupt communications satellites and GPS systems, as proved to be the case on this occasion in September 2017. Professor Michail Mathioudakis from the School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast, who also worked on the project, added: \"This is a unique set of observations that, for the first time, provide a detailed map of the magnetic field in coronal loops. \"This highly rewarding result was achieved due to the dedication and perseverance of our early career scientists who planned and executed the observations. The methodology used in this work and the result itself, will open new avenues in the study of the solar corona.\" More information: D. Kuridze et al.

          "Credit...Minh Uong/The New York TimesMarch 29, 2019One day in 2015, Barbara Lavenders husband returned from a U.F.O. conference and handed her a business card. It bore a red theater-curtain background, a vintage microphone and gold-and-white lettering that read: Sean David Morton, Radio Host, Public Speaker, Author, Director, Screen Writer, Actor. The polymathic Mr. Morton, Jeff Lavender told his wife, was U.F.O. royalty.Mr. Morton had spent years whisking E.T.-obsessed tourists to Area 51 for $99 a pop, then leveraged his following into stints on the wee-hours conspiracy show Coast to Coast AM at one point, the nations No. 3 talk-radio program. He dabbled in other fringe arts, such as remote viewing and psychic predictions about earthquakes, elections and the stock market. But by the time Mr. Lavender saw him talk in Southern California, Mr. Morton had shifted to something truly fantastical: instant debt relief.Hed been peddling a workshop called The Sovereign Factor: The Revolution Starts With You a nod to what is known as the sovereign citizens movement. A loose network of perhaps tens of thousands of far-right antigovernment extremists, sovereigns share certain conspiratorial beliefs and, sometimes, a desire to profit off a government whose legitimacy they deny.Do you realize, read Mr. Mortons workshop description, you are ALL considered Incompetent, Wards of the State, Residents and the Chattel Property of the US Federal government, until you declare your Emancipation? Learn all the secrets about how to get the government off your back and out of your life once and for all!! One of these secrets was called the bond process. By submitting the right set of papers, Mr. Morton said, you could wipe out your mortgage, tax bills and student loans.Mr. Mortons message had appeal beyond the tinfoil-hat crowd. In America after the Great Recession, plenty of people with upside-down mortgages and student debt were inclined to believe anyone offering help. Ms. Lavender, listening to her husband recap the workshop, was intrigued. Years earlier, shed borrowed $48,000 to help her son attend college. She and her husband had worked in the mortgage industry in Southern California for decades, but educational debt was unfamiliar terrain. I had never gone to college myself, she told me recently. I took out a loan I shouldnt have. Ms. Lavender lost her job and deferred the payments, and the interest kept piling up. By the time she held Mr. Mortons business card in her hands, she owed $70,000.She realized a U.F.O. gathering was an unusual venue for debt-relief advice. Her husbands annual get-togethers with the X-Files crowd were a hobby for him, and a good-natured punch line for their family. But the size and intractability of her loan balance weighed on her; also, she trusted her husband, and he thought Mr. Mortons bond process was worth checking out. She told me, I think he probably was enticed by it because it might have been a little tiny kick in the pants to the government.As the Lavenders came to discover, sovereign fraudsters are the snake-oil salesmen of our time. Peddling a bouquet of grifts as varied as tax fraud and real estate scams, they prey on our suspicion of institutions, financial illiteracy, greed and despair. You dont even have to buy into sovereign dogma to get swindled. You just need to be, as Ms. Lavender was, in debt. From 1990 to 2013, far-right extremists carried out more than 600 financial schemes that resulted in criminal charges, according to the researchers who run the U.S. Extremist Financial Crime Database, which is affiliated with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism and is the only clearinghouse of its kind.That adds up to conservatively public losses of $1 billion. The majority of perpetrators were either sovereigns or their ideological cousins, tax defiers. Fraud is to them what cross-burning is to white supremacists: an expression of belief.1. What sovereign citizens believeSovereigns, who sometimes call themselves freemen or state citizens, have no foundational document, but broadly they subscribe to an alternate version of American history. The tale can vary from sovereign to sovereign, but it goes roughly like this: At some point, a corporation secretly usurped the United States government, then went bankrupt and sought aid from international bankers. As collateral, the corporation offered the financiers us. As sovereigns tell it, your birth certificate and Social Security card are not benign documents, but contracts that enslave you.There is, they believe, a pathway to freedom: Renounce these contracts or otherwise assert your sovereignty. (Mr. Morton said he once told the Social Security Administration, I dont want this number.) Then no one not the taxman, not the police can tell you what to do. Not all sovereigns are con men, but their belief system lends itself to deceit. You might declare yourself a diplomat from a nonexistent country. (Mr. Morton represented the Republic of New Lemuria and the Dominion of Melchizedek.) Or start a fake Native American tribe. Or blow off a court case because the American flag in the courtroom has gold fringe. Some sovereigns have even lashed out violently at law enforcement officers, which is why theyre considered a domestic terrorism threat.Many sovereign myths hark back to the creation, in 1913, of the Federal Reserve. It was this weird, complicated instrument for controlling the monetary system. People saw it as sinister, the author J. M. Berger told me. In a recent paper, Mr. Berger traced the circulation of these ideas, in part, to a company named Omni Publications, which was something like the Infowars of the middle of the 20th century. One Omni title, The Federal Reserve Conspiracy, claimed that enemy aliens had infiltrated the banking system, and that their biographies could be found in Whos Who in American Jewry. (Sovereign lore is often rooted in anti-Semitism.) By the 1970s, the intellectual father of the sovereign citizen movement, William Potter Gale, helped spread this type of falsehood to a larger audience.The founder of the antigovernment group Posse Comitatus, Mr. Gale aligned himself with an emerging movement of tax protesters who argued, for instance, that paying taxes was a form of involuntary servitude. In turn, he introduced them to his warped version of America, where patriots establish their own legal system and hang those who defy it. Mr. Gales specific gift was wrapping nonsense in enough legalese that it sounded real. If you have this movement that offers you essentially a lot of magic words that you can say to get out of trouble, thats going to really appeal to people who are desperate and angry, Mr. Berger said. Mr. Gales outreach was a success. Over time, the line between thousands of tax protesters and Posse members blurred.Take redemption a theory popularized, in part, by a Gale associate. Remember how the corporation-slash-fake-government used us as collateral? According to sovereign lore, this means the government set up secret accounts in our names. Some believe they contain the oddly specific amount of $630,000. (To be clear, this is pure fantasy, according to the Internal Revenue Service.)One way sovereigns try to make the imaginary money real is by abusing legitimate I.R.S. forms. Law-abiding taxpayers use Form 1099-OID, for example, to report original issue discount income. But some sovereigns write in fake OID income, and fake withholding, in order to claim illegitimate refunds. If you file such a return, you risk at the very least a large fine. Yet from 2012 to 2014, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the I.R.S. received close to 7,000 sham OID filings.Chronically underfunded and understaffed, I.R.S. investigators refer only about two dozen sovereign-scam cases, on average, for prosecution each year. The agency sometimes misses returns that should raise suspicion. For example, in 2016, the I.R.S. discovered a sizable redemption scheme but only after processing 207 bogus returns and disbursing more than $43 million. Thats another reason these strange theories persist, and have begun to leach out of the sovereign network and into the general population: Sometimes, improbably, they work.2. They just went berserkMr. Morton was born in 1958, and his comfortable childhood in Northern California was a tutorial in how to make a sales pitch. His mother, Maureen Kennedy Salaman, was as San Francisco magazine once described her a millionaire evangelical alternative-medicine fanatic who promoted questionable cancer treatments.She was also a member of the John Birch Society, the far-right group known for its paranoid anticommunism, and she stockpiled beans, grains and ammunition in case of a Russian invasion. In 1984, she was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee for the Populist Party, a favorite of white supremacists. (Its presidential candidate the following cycle was the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke.) In her acceptance speech, she warned the crowd: Were up against the most evil and powerful conspiracy the world has ever known.When Mr. Morton reached adulthood, he sold unorthodox beliefs from behind a suburban-dad veneer: a flop of dark hair, a round, clean-shaven face, and a button-down-and-khakis wardrobe. He was charismatic but also childlike, friends said, his ego easily bruised. He branded himself an investigative reporter within the U.F.O. world, and in the 1990s, when Mr. Morton appeared on The Montel Williams Show, he made outrageous claims more than 100 alien species had visited Earth! with the certainty of a Nobel laureate. I got close enough to one of these things that was floating around in the desert to actually get my face burned by it, he said.Even other U.F.O. enthusiasts considered him a kook, but Mr. Mortons fans didnt care. The truth was out there and Sean David Morton had it. Branding himself a prophet, he plumbed the new-age convention circuit alongside specialists in animal telepathy, chakras, hauntings, angelic gemstone messages and the afterlife. Near the end of the millennium, at a convention in Las Vegas, a blue-eyed, reddish-haired woman approached him. Back in Utah, Melissa Thomson had grown up in a Mormon home and married at 22; she worked in banking and, in her spare time, doted on her pedigreed cats, even serving as treasurer of the local Cat Fanciers group. The Coast to Coast program was her escape, and she spent hours fan-girling over Mr. Morton, a frequent guest.ImageCredit...Project CamelotAt the Las Vegas convention, Ms. Thomson apparently had one goal: to meet her idol. It was love at first sight, Mr. Morton said. She soon left her husband and joined Mr. Morton in Southern California. Her oldest brother, Robert, told me, The more we found out, the more we warned Melissa that he is just not a decent person at all. But he promised her movie roles; theyll inherit Mommys home in Atherton, her condo in Tahoe. All she could see was dollars. When they got married, her family refused to attend.(Through her lawyer, Ms. Morton declined to comment. Mr. Morton did not respond to multiple requests for comment, although he said on YouTube last fall that The New York Times was conducting a massive smear campaign against him. Unless otherwise noted, all of his quotes in this article are from court records.)The Mortons lived in Hermosa Beach, a surf spot about 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles. Next to its mini-palaces, their oatmeal-colored apartment building resembled servants quarters, but it was a short stroll to the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Morton welcomed his new wifes bushy-tailed Norwegian forest cats when a new litter arrived, more than a dozen scampered around the apartment and in turn she oversaw the administrative side of being Sean David Morton. He shilled conspiracy fiction (The Dark Prophet Veil of the Anti-Christ); CDs (Everything You Wanted to Know About the Future Vol. 2); a $65 newsletter with thousands of subscribers (TOMORROWS HEADLINES TODAY!).Either this wasnt particularly lucrative, or it wasnt lucrative enough to replicate Mr. Mortons childhood wealth. From the outside, it was hard to tell. He was always asking me to try and help him to do something so that he could raise some money, said Susan Shumsky, a fellow fixture on the new-age circuit. Like, Lets do a trip to Peru so I can have some money. Lets do a tele-seminar so that I can make some money. Ms. Mortons pedigreed kittens, which sold for hundreds of dollars each, apparently kept them solvent. At various points, she also dog-walked and worked at Disneyland. Their friend Will Chappell said, It was him leading the charge, him leading the family. She did what was necessary to accomplish his goals.Early in their relationship, a website called UFO Watchdog Exposing the Parasites, Delusional Personalities, Morons and Frauds Currently Clouding the UFO Issue dismantled much of Mr. Mortons official biography. Mr. Morton sued; the case was dismissed. But in an email included in the case file, Ms. Morton waved off the findings: I would only be concerned if Sean DIDNT have critics. Some of the greatest people in history have had people attacking them at every step. It just means that Sean is doing something right and trying to make a difference in the world.By 2006, the couple was expecting a windfall. Ms. Salaman was in poor health; when she died, Mr. Morton assumed hed inherit some of his mothers fortune. But their relationship, already frosty, iced over in her final weeks. Ms. Salaman didnt even want her son and his wife to visit. She cut them both out of her will, even as she kept a $100,000 trust for her Great Dane, Duke.They just both went berserk, Ms. Mortons brother recalled. Its just been scam after scam after scam.3. A deposit from the government for half a million dollarsWhile the sovereign citizen movement is inherently not organized, some members of the firmament become known as gurus, and are vectors for spreading the ideology. Mr. Morton often lectured at the Living Temple, a new age shop just south of Hermosa Beach. The owner favored a black T-shirt with five flying saucers and the admonition KEEP LOOKING UP, and yoga music ommed through a clutter of apothecary bottles, bags of herbal something, miracle-cleanse guidebooks and crop-circle DVDs.One day, most likely in 2008, a man named Brandon Adams started showing up. Like Mr. Morton, he was a budding sovereign amplifier but he was so much younger that his untucked button-downs looked like an attempt at playing dress-up. His family ran a local tax-prep business. His whole thing was the banks, Mr. Morton said later. What he considered the great criminal conspiracy between the Internal Revenue Service and the banking cartels. Mr. Morton quickly got him a speaking slot.Some of Mr. Adamss talks were recorded. Pacing in front of a few dozen people, scribbling phrases and stick figures on a whiteboard, he wove a dark tale. The secret bankruptcy. The people-as-collateral. Then, a twist: The banks were skimming money from or fractionalizing every transaction we make. He told the group they could reclaim the funds via Form 1099-OID.From a folding chair, Mr. Morton looking grayer and rounder than during his Montel Williams days asked Mr. Adams if anyone had really gotten a big refund that way. Yes, Mr. Adams said. The funny thing is, watch how quiet people start to get when theyre not so sure about the process and they do start getting the returns. Laughter. Theyve got that mentality: Im not going to say I just got two hundred and fifty grand.The audience lapped it up. This was America during the financial crisis: The banks had been bailed out, but not homeowners, and the era of Tea Party rallies and Occupy Wall Street encampments was imminent. It wasnt too much of a leap to suspect that Washington was in cahoots with the likes of J.P. Morgan. Mr. Adamss Living Temple talks drew large enough crowds that he moved to a bigger venue and sold private coaching for $200 an hour. It became a movement, really, Mr. Morton said. (Mr. Adams did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)In the spring of 2009, under Mr. Adamss tutelage, the Mortons tried the OID scheme themselves. Mr. Morton filed four years of returns from 2005 to 2008 and claimed nearly $4 million in refunds. His wife filed a 2007 return and claimed about $12,000. I never, ever, ever in any of this thought that I was breaking a law, Mr. Morton later said. I thought that this was the law. His faith was bolstered when, that April, he got a refund for one of his returns: a direct deposit to their Washington Mutual account of $480,322.55.4. Rich people find loopholes. Why not us?In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission went after the Mortons for a different scheme one with no connection to sovereign ideology. Mr. Morton had used his unconventional celebrity a few years earlier to begin an investment club, where he would channel his psychic powers into predicting foreign currency markets. Its a risky type of trading, but Mr. Morton bragged that his forecasts were so accurate that even Henry Paulson, then the Treasury secretary, relied on them.After hearing Mr. Morton promote the fund on Coast to Coast, a man from Washington State invested $217,000. An elderly New York woman parted with $20,000. Hes promising the stars, recalled Tim Saunders, an Alaska electrician who poured in his life savings of $135,000. Yeah, my greed came out, and I felt I needed more, and quickly. In all, more than 100 people invested $6 million. Mr. Morton sank only half of it into foreign-currency trading nearly all of which he lost. At least $240,000 was funneled to a nonprofit the Mortons set up, and authorities dont know where the rest is. In 2013, the S.E.C. won an $11.5 million judgment against him. (Ms. Morton was a relief defendant, meaning she was accused only of profiting from the scheme.)The Mortons filed for bankruptcy, but repeatedly misled the government for instance, when they claimed not to have bank accounts. A court eventually denied their discharge, meaning they couldnt get rid of their debt. They were also tossed out of their beach-adjacent apartment. Bottom line, Ms. Morton told the bankruptcy trustee one day, I just want to be able to get a decent job, have a nice place to live, pay my taxes, and just have my life back.It was around this time that the Mortons turned to hawking the debt-erasing sovereign scheme known as the bond process. Over two years, they helped people around the country send nearly two dozen fake bonds to the I.R.S., Quicken Loans, PennyMac, Bank of America, Chase Bank and the treasurers office in Contra Costa County, California. Early in 2015, Barbara Lavender, the woman whose husband met Mr. Morton at a U.F.O. conference, gave him a call.Ms. Lavender is 61 and a front-desk clerk at an adult school. When I met her last year in Hemet, Calif., nearly 90 parched miles east of Los Angeles, her ranch-style home was trimmed in red Christmas lights. We chatted at her kitchen table, with her 14-year-old dog, Remy, curled at our feet. She explained that when she spoke to Mr. Morton over the phone, he avoided talking about sovereign ideology. Instead, he said she could purchase a portion of a bond that he held and almost magically make her educational loan disappear.To wipe out her $70,000 balance, he suggested Ms. Lavender should send him $2,500, or less than 4 percent of what she owed. She and her husband believed Mr. Morton had discovered the sort of workaround rich people find. You know, she testified later. You hear it all the time: wealthy with tax loopholes, and that kind of thing.The bond looked authentically bureaucratic, with a formal scalloped border. It was really certificate paper from Office Depot. The accompanying paperwork said that the student loan company was entitled to be paid back from a fund that, in reality, the United States taps to help stabilize foreign currencies. Mr. Morton said he warned Ms. Lavender: Look, I dont know if this is going to work. Im not a lawyer. He added, Its all going to depend on whether or not they accept it.A month after the Mortons mailed the bond package, Ms. Lavender checked her educational loan balance, saw it hadnt budged and wrote Ms. Morton an email. She didnt get a response. Ms. Lavender sent follow-up after follow-up. This is beginning to feel increasingly more like a scam, she wrote that October, where we were bilked out of hard-earned money we did not have to spare.Ms. Morton finally replied and said shed been recovering from knee surgery. Ms. Lavender sent an almost apologetic response. Her attention was elsewhere her husband had died suddenly from a brain mass. Once you hear from Sean, can you let me know what he thinks we should do next? she wrote. With my husband gone, this debt is now an even greater burden for me as he was the main breadwinner.Nothing came of the exchange. That winter, two men in jackets showed up at Ms. Lavenders home and questioned her about the Mortons, the bond process, the outcome. Afterward, Ms. Lavender took one of their business cards to her nephew, who works for the local sheriffs office. Yes, he reassured her. They really are from the I.R.S.5. The Conspira-Sea CruiseOn Jan. 31, 2016, a nearly 200-foot-tall, white-and-blue cruise ship called the Ruby Princess docked at the Port of Los Angeles. About 100 guests on board had paid $3,000 each for what was marketed as the Conspira-Sea Cruise a weeklong jaunt through Mexican waters and American paranoia, from Vaccinations: Do You Really Know Whats Coming Through That Needle? to Conspiracy to Steal Your Body and Soul. As the Mortons prepared to disembark, they were arrested by federal agents.ImageCredit...George Rose/Getty ImagesAfter years of digging by I.R.S. investigators, the Mortons faced a suite of charges related to their tax filings and fake bonds. Once off the Ruby Princess, where Mr. Morton had led a workshop called From Fascism to Freedom, they were separated, patted down and asked what medications they took. Mr. Morton said to ask Melissa about his. An agent did. Cyanide, she said, seething. On the way to jail, she added, Do me a favor and tell Sean this: Thank you and Ill see you in the next life.Their trial began just before Tax Day, 2017. The prosecution told a simple story of greed. I submit the I.R.S. was a slot machine, one prosecutor, Valerie Makarewicz, said. Keep hitting spin. Keep playing until you hit that jackpot. The same day the Mortons got their $480,322.55 refund, she said, they went to the bank and drained nearly all of their account. Once the I.R.S. realized its mistake and tried to recoup the money, the Mortons filed two more rounds of bogus returns and a set of fake bonds.Ms. Mortons lawyer presented a good-faith defense. She was under the thrall of sovereign gurus, he said, people who kind of strutted back and forth on the stage with an answer for everything. He showed the jury 37 pages of perfect-cursive notes Ms. Morton took at a Brandon Adams lecture. In this courtroom, its obviously nonsense. But at that time, people believed it, and Melissa Morton believed it.Mr. Morton represented himself. Im not a rapist, a thug, a war criminal, he said during his opening statement. I didnt run a Nazi concentration camp and murder millions of children.Serving as his own lawyer also meant he cross-examined witnesses. Are you familiar with the bankruptcy of the United States in 1933? he asked the governments fraud expert. It was a reference to the sovereign conspiracy theory.No, the witness said. Im not.During his closing argument, on the trials fourth day, Mr. Morton told the jury about the Norwegian forest cats. Earlier in the week, he said, he and his wife tried to save a premature kitten. They stayed up late, swaddled her in cloth, fed her milk with an eye dropper. The kitten died anyway. Ask yourselves, he implored the jurors, Do we send these nice people who care for kittens and raise cats to jail forever? The panel deliberated for two hours. When they returned, Ms. Morton greeted them with a hopeful smile. The verdict: guilty on all counts. She fainted.Around this time, other prominent sovereigns were facing a reckoning. A court had permanently barred Mr. Adams from preparing tax returns or promoting the OID scheme; he ended up in prison for peddling fake money orders. Another guru on the Conspira-Sea Cruise named Winston Shrout (workshop: Conspiracy of the Court System) was awaiting trial in Oregon.Mr. Mortons sentencing was set for that June. But when the 11 a.m. hearing started, he didnt show.6. A post-eclipse, poolside bustAgents spotted him that afternoon outside a Dominos in Hermosa Beach, a gray hood and sunglasses shrouding much of his face. He hopped in his white Ford Escape and headed south. The next morning, he tweeted a plea for donations: Melissa (and the cats) need help relocating.Two months passed. Mr. Morton resurfaced via video on a friends online talk show, Project Camelot (Getting the Truth Out One Whistleblower at a Time). His hair was mussed, as if hed been startled awake, and he wore a headset, a black V-neck and dark-rimmed glasses that he took on and off.His version of hello was ripping his judge and prosecutors as the biggest gang of criminals youre ever going to see. Soon, he turned his attention to the impending solar eclipse. This is one of the biggest turning points in American history! he said. The video clocked more than 40,000 views. It was vintage Sean David Morton, which is to say it was impossible to tell what, if anything, he believed.I once asked Will Chappell, who has known the Mortons for more than a decade, whether they were actual sovereign dogmatists. He said, She definitely believed in the story that Sean was telling. I believe that Sean believed in the story that he was telling. A little bit, I believed in it. And now, after their convictions? Melissa, of course, knowing what she knew now, she would have been gone a long time ago. I think Sean would have still done what he did. He still thinks he just missed a step.The solar eclipse took place in August, the week after Mr. Mortons on-the-lam interview. Though Ms. Morton promised the court she would have no contact with her fugitive husband, the couple rendezvoused at a hotel just outside Palm Springs. That morning, after the moon briefly blotted out the sun, Mr. Morton was lounging poolside in swim trunks, purple mountains arrayed above him, eclipse glasses at his side. An I.R.S. agent walked up. It was over.At their sentencing, Ms. Morton distanced herself from him. I am a living embodiment of love is blind, she wrote to the judge. If I ever questioned the teachings and processes by others, I was told, who was I to question others who were far smarter than I? There were thousands of attendees to the workshops and seminars. It was so convincing, well-organized and very believable. How could thousands of people be wrong? She was sentenced to two years in prison and has filed an appeal. Behind bars, she passed time taking classes rsum-writing, watercolor-painting, embroidery and watching the Food Network; she was recently transferred to a halfway house. Emails posted on the Project Camelot site suggest she and her husband are still in touch.Mr. Morton was sentenced to six years in prison. Hes representing himself on appeal, and in court papers he argued that hed been improperly profiled as a terrorist sovereign citizen. On Project Camelot, hes unrepentant even sharing a pardon request he said he sent to President Trump.Its because of my work in RADIO and TV INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM that DEEP STATE forces within the D.O.J. put my wife and I in prison for YEARS! he wrote. Of course, he had a suggestion for how to correct this injustice: donate to his PayPal account. ",

        "url_text": "Credit...Minh Uong/The New York TimesMarch 29, 2019One day in 2015, Barbara Lavenders husband returned from a U.F.O. conference and handed her a business card. It bore a red theater-curtain background, a vintage microphone and gold-and-white lettering that read: Sean David Morton, Radio Host, Public Speaker, Author, Director, Screen Writer, Actor. The polymathic Mr. Morton, Jeff Lavender told his wife, was U.F.O. royalty.Mr. Morton had spent years whisking E.T.-obsessed tourists to Area 51 for $99 a pop, then leveraged his following into stints on the wee-hours conspiracy show Coast to Coast AM at one point, the nations No. 3 talk-radio program. He dabbled in other fringe arts, such as remote viewing and psychic predictions about earthquakes, elections and the stock market. But by the time Mr. Lavender saw him talk in Southern California, Mr. Morton had shifted to something truly fantastical: instant debt relief.Hed been peddling a workshop called The Sovereign Factor: The Revolution Starts With You a nod to what is known as the sovereign citizens movement. A loose network of perhaps tens of thousands of far-right antigovernment extremists, sovereigns share certain conspiratorial beliefs and, sometimes, a desire to profit off a government whose legitimacy they deny.Do you realize, read Mr. Mortons workshop description, you are ALL considered Incompetent, Wards of the State, Residents and the Chattel Property of the US Federal government, until you declare your Emancipation? Learn all the secrets about how to get the government off your back and out of your life once and for all!! One of these secrets was called the bond process. By submitting the right set of papers, Mr. Morton said, you could wipe out your mortgage, tax bills and student loans.Mr. Mortons message had appeal beyond the tinfoil-hat crowd. In America after the Great Recession, plenty of people with upside-down mortgages and student debt were inclined to believe anyone offering help. Ms. Lavender, listening to her husband recap the workshop, was intrigued. Years earlier, shed borrowed $48,000 to help her son attend college. She and her husband had worked in the mortgage industry in Southern California for decades, but educational debt was unfamiliar terrain. I had never gone to college myself, she told me recently. I took out a loan I shouldnt have. Ms. Lavender lost her job and deferred the payments, and the interest kept piling up. By the time she held Mr. Mortons business card in her hands, she owed $70,000.She realized a U.F.O. gathering was an unusual venue for debt-relief advice. Her husbands annual get-togethers with the X-Files crowd were a hobby for him, and a good-natured punch line for their family. But the size and intractability of her loan balance weighed on her; also, she trusted her husband, and he thought Mr. Mortons bond process was worth checking out. She told me, I think he probably was enticed by it because it might have been a little tiny kick in the pants to the government.As the Lavenders came to discover, sovereign fraudsters are the snake-oil salesmen of our time. Peddling a bouquet of grifts as varied as tax fraud and real estate scams, they prey on our suspicion of institutions, financial illiteracy, greed and despair. You dont even have to buy into sovereign dogma to get swindled. You just need to be, as Ms. Lavender was, in debt. From 1990 to 2013, far-right extremists carried out more than 600 financial schemes that resulted in criminal charges, according to the researchers who run the U.S. Extremist Financial Crime Database, which is affiliated with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism and is the only clearinghouse of its kind.That adds up to conservatively public losses of $1 billion. The majority of perpetrators were either sovereigns or their ideological cousins, tax defiers. Fraud is to them what cross-burning is to white supremacists: an expression of belief.1. What sovereign citizens believeSovereigns, who sometimes call themselves freemen or state citizens, have no foundational document, but broadly they subscribe to an alternate version of American history. The tale can vary from sovereign to sovereign, but it goes roughly like this: At some point, a corporation secretly usurped the United States government, then went bankrupt and sought aid from international bankers. As collateral, the corporation offered the financiers us. As sovereigns tell it, your birth certificate and Social Security card are not benign documents, but contracts that enslave you.There is, they believe, a pathway to freedom: Renounce these contracts or otherwise assert your sovereignty. (Mr. Morton said he once told the Social Security Administration, I dont want this number.) Then no one not the taxman, not the police can tell you what to do. Not all sovereigns are con men, but their belief system lends itself to deceit. You might declare yourself a diplomat from a nonexistent country. (Mr. Morton represented the Republic of New Lemuria and the Dominion of Melchizedek.) Or start a fake Native American tribe. Or blow off a court case because the American flag in the courtroom has gold fringe. Some sovereigns have even lashed out violently at law enforcement officers, which is why theyre considered a domestic terrorism threat.Many sovereign myths hark back to the creation, in 1913, of the Federal Reserve. It was this weird, complicated instrument for controlling the monetary system. People saw it as sinister, the author J. M. Berger told me. In a recent paper, Mr. Berger traced the circulation of these ideas, in part, to a company named Omni Publications, which was something like the Infowars of the middle of the 20th century. One Omni title, The Federal Reserve Conspiracy, claimed that enemy aliens had infiltrated the banking system, and that their biographies could be found in Whos Who in American Jewry. (Sovereign lore is often rooted in anti-Semitism.) By the 1970s, the intellectual father of the sovereign citizen movement, William Potter Gale, helped spread this type of falsehood to a larger audience.The founder of the antigovernment group Posse Comitatus, Mr. Gale aligned himself with an emerging movement of tax protesters who argued, for instance, that paying taxes was a form of involuntary servitude. In turn, he introduced them to his warped version of America, where patriots establish their own legal system and hang those who defy it. Mr. Gales specific gift was wrapping nonsense in enough legalese that it sounded real. If you have this movement that offers you essentially a lot of magic words that you can say to get out of trouble, thats going to really appeal to people who are desperate and angry, Mr. Berger said. Mr. Gales outreach was a success. Over time, the line between thousands of tax protesters and Posse members blurred.Take redemption a theory popularized, in part, by a Gale associate. Remember how the corporation-slash-fake-government used us as collateral? According to sovereign lore, this means the government set up secret accounts in our names. Some believe they contain the oddly specific amount of $630,000. (To be clear, this is pure fantasy, according to the Internal Revenue Service.)One way sovereigns try to make the imaginary money real is by abusing legitimate I.R.S. forms. Law-abiding taxpayers use Form 1099-OID, for example, to report original issue discount income. But some sovereigns write in fake OID income, and fake withholding, in order to claim illegitimate refunds. If you file such a return, you risk at the very least a large fine. Yet from 2012 to 2014, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the I.R.S. received close to 7,000 sham OID filings.Chronically underfunded and understaffed, I.R.S. investigators refer only about two dozen sovereign-scam cases, on average, for prosecution each year. The agency sometimes misses returns that should raise suspicion. For example, in 2016, the I.R.S. discovered a sizable redemption scheme but only after processing 207 bogus returns and disbursing more than $43 million. Thats another reason these strange theories persist, and have begun to leach out of the sovereign network and into the general population: Sometimes, improbably, they work.2. They just went berserkMr. Morton was born in 1958, and his comfortable childhood in Northern California was a tutorial in how to make a sales pitch. His mother, Maureen Kennedy Salaman, was as San Francisco magazine once described her a millionaire evangelical alternative-medicine fanatic who promoted questionable cancer treatments.She was also a member of the John Birch Society, the far-right group known for its paranoid anticommunism, and she stockpiled beans, grains and ammunition in case of a Russian invasion. In 1984, she was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee for the Populist Party, a favorite of white supremacists. (Its presidential candidate the following cycle was the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke.) In her acceptance speech, she warned the crowd: Were up against the most evil and powerful conspiracy the world has ever known.When Mr. Morton reached adulthood, he sold unorthodox beliefs from behind a suburban-dad veneer: a flop of dark hair, a round, clean-shaven face, and a button-down-and-khakis wardrobe. He was charismatic but also childlike, friends said, his ego easily bruised. He branded himself an investigative reporter within the U.F.O. world, and in the 1990s, when Mr. Morton appeared on The Montel Williams Show, he made outrageous claims more than 100 alien species had visited Earth! with the certainty of a Nobel laureate. I got close enough to one of these things that was floating around in the desert to actually get my face burned by it, he said.Even other U.F.O. enthusiasts considered him a kook, but Mr. Mortons fans didnt care. The truth was out there and Sean David Morton had it. Branding himself a prophet, he plumbed the new-age convention circuit alongside specialists in animal telepathy, chakras, hauntings, angelic gemstone messages and the afterlife. Near the end of the millennium, at a convention in Las Vegas, a blue-eyed, reddish-haired woman approached him. Back in Utah, Melissa Thomson had grown up in a Mormon home and married at 22; she worked in banking and, in her spare time, doted on her pedigreed cats, even serving as treasurer of the local Cat Fanciers group. The Coast to Coast program was her escape, and she spent hours fan-girling over Mr. Morton, a frequent guest.ImageCredit...Project CamelotAt the Las Vegas convention, Ms. Thomson apparently had one goal: to meet her idol. It was love at first sight, Mr. Morton said. She soon left her husband and joined Mr. Morton in Southern California. Her oldest brother, Robert, told me, The more we found out, the more we warned Melissa that he is just not a decent person at all. But he promised her movie roles; theyll inherit Mommys home in Atherton, her condo in Tahoe. All she could see was dollars. When they got married, her family refused to attend.(Through her lawyer, Ms. Morton declined to comment. Mr. Morton did not respond to multiple requests for comment, although he said on YouTube last fall that The New York Times was conducting a massive smear campaign against him. Unless otherwise noted, all of his quotes in this article are from court records.)The Mortons lived in Hermosa Beach, a surf spot about 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles. Next to its mini-palaces, their oatmeal-colored apartment building resembled servants quarters, but it was a short stroll to the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Morton welcomed his new wifes bushy-tailed Norwegian forest cats when a new litter arrived, more than a dozen scampered around the apartment and in turn she oversaw the administrative side of being Sean David Morton. He shilled conspiracy fiction (The Dark Prophet Veil of the Anti-Christ); CDs (Everything You Wanted to Know About the Future Vol. 2); a $65 newsletter with thousands of subscribers (TOMORROWS HEADLINES TODAY!).Either this wasnt particularly lucrative, or it wasnt lucrative enough to replicate Mr. Mortons childhood wealth. From the outside, it was hard to tell. He was always asking me to try and help him to do something so that he could raise some money, said Susan Shumsky, a fellow fixture on the new-age circuit. Like, Lets do a trip to Peru so I can have some money. Lets do a tele-seminar so that I can make some money. Ms. Mortons pedigreed kittens, which sold for hundreds of dollars each, apparently kept them solvent. At various points, she also dog-walked and worked at Disneyland. Their friend Will Chappell said, It was him leading the charge, him leading the family. She did what was necessary to accomplish his goals.Early in their relationship, a website called UFO Watchdog Exposing the Parasites, Delusional Personalities, Morons and Frauds Currently Clouding the UFO Issue dismantled much of Mr. Mortons official biography. Mr. Morton sued; the case was dismissed. But in an email included in the case file, Ms. Morton waved off the findings: I would only be concerned if Sean DIDNT have critics. Some of the greatest people in history have had people attacking them at every step. It just means that Sean is doing something right and trying to make a difference in the world.By 2006, the couple was expecting a windfall. Ms. Salaman was in poor health; when she died, Mr. Morton assumed hed inherit some of his mothers fortune. But their relationship, already frosty, iced over in her final weeks. Ms. Salaman didnt even want her son and his wife to visit. She cut them both out of her will, even as she kept a $100,000 trust for her Great Dane, Duke.They just both went berserk, Ms. Mortons brother recalled. Its just been scam after scam after scam.3. A deposit from the government for half a million dollarsWhile the sovereign citizen movement is inherently not organized, some members of the firmament become known as gurus, and are vectors for spreading the ideology. Mr. Morton often lectured at the Living Temple, a new age shop just south of Hermosa Beach. The owner favored a black T-shirt with five flying saucers and the admonition KEEP LOOKING UP, and yoga music ommed through a clutter of apothecary bottles, bags of herbal something, miracle-cleanse guidebooks and crop-circle DVDs.One day, most likely in 2008, a man named Brandon Adams started showing up. Like Mr. Morton, he was a budding sovereign amplifier but he was so much younger that his untucked button-downs looked like an attempt at playing dress-up. His family ran a local tax-prep business. His whole thing was the banks, Mr. Morton said later. What he considered the great criminal conspiracy between the Internal Revenue Service and the banking cartels. Mr. Morton quickly got him a speaking slot.Some of Mr. Adamss talks were recorded. Pacing in front of a few dozen people, scribbling phrases and stick figures on a whiteboard, he wove a dark tale. The secret bankruptcy. The people-as-collateral. Then, a twist: The banks were skimming money from or fractionalizing every transaction we make. He told the group they could reclaim the funds via Form 1099-OID.From a folding chair, Mr. Morton looking grayer and rounder than during his Montel Williams days asked Mr. Adams if anyone had really gotten a big refund that way. Yes, Mr. Adams said. The funny thing is, watch how quiet people start to get when theyre not so sure about the process and they do start getting the returns. Laughter. Theyve got that mentality: Im not going to say I just got two hundred and fifty grand.The audience lapped it up. This was America during the financial crisis: The banks had been bailed out, but not homeowners, and the era of Tea Party rallies and Occupy Wall Street encampments was imminent. It wasnt too much of a leap to suspect that Washington was in cahoots with the likes of J.P. Morgan. Mr. Adamss Living Temple talks drew large enough crowds that he moved to a bigger venue and sold private coaching for $200 an hour. It became a movement, really, Mr. Morton said. (Mr. Adams did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)In the spring of 2009, under Mr. Adamss tutelage, the Mortons tried the OID scheme themselves. Mr. Morton filed four years of returns from 2005 to 2008 and claimed nearly $4 million in refunds. His wife filed a 2007 return and claimed about $12,000. I never, ever, ever in any of this thought that I was breaking a law, Mr. Morton later said. I thought that this was the law. His faith was bolstered when, that April, he got a refund for one of his returns: a direct deposit to their Washington Mutual account of $480,322.55.4. Rich people find loopholes. Why not us?In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission went after the Mortons for a different scheme one with no connection to sovereign ideology. Mr. Morton had used his unconventional celebrity a few years earlier to begin an investment club, where he would channel his psychic powers into predicting foreign currency markets. Its a risky type of trading, but Mr. Morton bragged that his forecasts were so accurate that even Henry Paulson, then the Treasury secretary, relied on them.After hearing Mr. Morton promote the fund on Coast to Coast, a man from Washington State invested $217,000. An elderly New York woman parted with $20,000. Hes promising the stars, recalled Tim Saunders, an Alaska electrician who poured in his life savings of $135,000. Yeah, my greed came out, and I felt I needed more, and quickly. In all, more than 100 people invested $6 million. Mr. Morton sank only half of it into foreign-currency trading nearly all of which he lost. At least $240,000 was funneled to a nonprofit the Mortons set up, and authorities dont know where the rest is. In 2013, the S.E.C. won an $11.5 million judgment against him. (Ms. Morton was a relief defendant, meaning she was accused only of profiting from the scheme.)The Mortons filed for bankruptcy, but repeatedly misled the government for instance, when they claimed not to have bank accounts. A court eventually denied their discharge, meaning they couldnt get rid of their debt. They were also tossed out of their beach-adjacent apartment. Bottom line, Ms. Morton told the bankruptcy trustee one day, I just want to be able to get a decent job, have a nice place to live, pay my taxes, and just have my life back.It was around this time that the Mortons turned to hawking the debt-erasing sovereign scheme known as the bond process. Over two years, they helped people around the country send nearly two dozen fake bonds to the I.R.S., Quicken Loans, PennyMac, Bank of America, Chase Bank and the treasurers office in Contra Costa County, California. Early in 2015, Barbara Lavender, the woman whose husband met Mr. Morton at a U.F.O. conference, gave him a call.Ms. Lavender is 61 and a front-desk clerk at an adult school. When I met her last year in Hemet, Calif., nearly 90 parched miles east of Los Angeles, her ranch-style home was trimmed in red Christmas lights. We chatted at her kitchen table, with her 14-year-old dog, Remy, curled at our feet. She explained that when she spoke to Mr. Morton over the phone, he avoided talking about sovereign ideology. Instead, he said she could purchase a portion of a bond that he held and almost magically make her educational loan disappear.To wipe out her $70,000 balance, he suggested Ms. Lavender should send him $2,500, or less than 4 percent of what she owed. She and her husband believed Mr. Morton had discovered the sort of workaround rich people find. You know, she testified later. You hear it all the time: wealthy with tax loopholes, and that kind of thing.The bond looked authentically bureaucratic, with a formal scalloped border. It was really certificate paper from Office Depot. The accompanying paperwork said that the student loan company was entitled to be paid back from a fund that, in reality, the United States taps to help stabilize foreign currencies. Mr. Morton said he warned Ms. Lavender: Look, I dont know if this is going to work. Im not a lawyer. He added, Its all going to depend on whether or not they accept it.A month after the Mortons mailed the bond package, Ms. Lavender checked her educational loan balance, saw it hadnt budged and wrote Ms. Morton an email. She didnt get a response. Ms. Lavender sent follow-up after follow-up. This is beginning to feel increasingly more like a scam, she wrote that October, where we were bilked out of hard-earned money we did not have to spare.Ms. Morton finally replied and said shed been recovering from knee surgery. Ms. Lavender sent an almost apologetic response. Her attention was elsewhere her husband had died suddenly from a brain mass. Once you hear from Sean, can you let me know what he thinks we should do next? she wrote. With my husband gone, this debt is now an even greater burden for me as he was the main breadwinner.Nothing came of the exchange. That winter, two men in jackets showed up at Ms. Lavenders home and questioned her about the Mortons, the bond process, the outcome. Afterward, Ms. Lavender took one of their business cards to her nephew, who works for the local sheriffs office. Yes, he reassured her. They really are from the I.R.S.5. The Conspira-Sea CruiseOn Jan. 31, 2016, a nearly 200-foot-tall, white-and-blue cruise ship called the Ruby Princess docked at the Port of Los Angeles. About 100 guests on board had paid $3,000 each for what was marketed as the Conspira-Sea Cruise a weeklong jaunt through Mexican waters and American paranoia, from Vaccinations: Do You Really Know Whats Coming Through That Needle? to Conspiracy to Steal Your Body and Soul. As the Mortons prepared to disembark, they were arrested by federal agents.ImageCredit...George Rose/Getty ImagesAfter years of digging by I.R.S. investigators, the Mortons faced a suite of charges related to their tax filings and fake bonds. Once off the Ruby Princess, where Mr. Morton had led a workshop called From Fascism to Freedom, they were separated, patted down and asked what medications they took. Mr. Morton said to ask Melissa about his. An agent did. Cyanide, she said, seething. On the way to jail, she added, Do me a favor and tell Sean this: Thank you and Ill see you in the next life.Their trial began just before Tax Day, 2017. The prosecution told a simple story of greed. I submit the I.R.S. was a slot machine, one prosecutor, Valerie Makarewicz, said. Keep hitting spin. Keep playing until you hit that jackpot. The same day the Mortons got their $480,322.55 refund, she said, they went to the bank and drained nearly all of their account. Once the I.R.S. realized its mistake and tried to recoup the money, the Mortons filed two more rounds of bogus returns and a set of fake bonds.Ms. Mortons lawyer presented a good-faith defense. She was under the thrall of sovereign gurus, he said, people who kind of strutted back and forth on the stage with an answer for everything. He showed the jury 37 pages of perfect-cursive notes Ms. Morton took at a Brandon Adams lecture. In this courtroom, its obviously nonsense. But at that time, people believed it, and Melissa Morton believed it.Mr. Morton represented himself. Im not a rapist, a thug, a war criminal, he said during his opening statement. I didnt run a Nazi concentration camp and murder millions of children.Serving as his own lawyer also meant he cross-examined witnesses. Are you familiar with the bankruptcy of the United States in 1933? he asked the governments fraud expert. It was a reference to the sovereign conspiracy theory.No, the witness said. Im not.During his closing argument, on the trials fourth day, Mr. Morton told the jury about the Norwegian forest cats. Earlier in the week, he said, he and his wife tried to save a premature kitten. They stayed up late, swaddled her in cloth, fed her milk with an eye dropper. The kitten died anyway. Ask yourselves, he implored the jurors, Do we send these nice people who care for kittens and raise cats to jail forever? The panel deliberated for two hours. When they returned, Ms. Morton greeted them with a hopeful smile. The verdict: guilty on all counts. She fainted.Around this time, other prominent sovereigns were facing a reckoning. A court had permanently barred Mr. Adams from preparing tax returns or promoting the OID scheme; he ended up in prison for peddling fake money orders. Another guru on the Conspira-Sea Cruise named Winston Shrout (workshop: Conspiracy of the Court System) was awaiting trial in Oregon.Mr. Mortons sentencing was set for that June. But when the 11 a.m. hearing started, he didnt show.6. A post-eclipse, poolside bustAgents spotted him that afternoon outside a Dominos in Hermosa Beach, a gray hood and sunglasses shrouding much of his face. He hopped in his white Ford Escape and headed south. The next morning, he tweeted a plea for donations: Melissa (and the cats) need help relocating.Two months passed. Mr. Morton resurfaced via video on a friends online talk show, Project Camelot (Getting the Truth Out One Whistleblower at a Time). His hair was mussed, as if hed been startled awake, and he wore a headset, a black V-neck and dark-rimmed glasses that he took on and off.His version of hello was ripping his judge and prosecutors as the biggest gang of criminals youre ever going to see. Soon, he turned his attention to the impending solar eclipse. This is one of the biggest turning points in American history! he said. The video clocked more than 40,000 views. It was vintage Sean David Morton, which is to say it was impossible to tell what, if anything, he believed.I once asked Will Chappell, who has known the Mortons for more than a decade, whether they were actual sovereign dogmatists. He said, She definitely believed in the story that Sean was telling. I believe that Sean believed in the story that he was telling. A little bit, I believed in it. And now, after their convictions? Melissa, of course, knowing what she knew now, she would have been gone a long time ago. I think Sean would have still done what he did. He still thinks he just missed a step.The solar eclipse took place in August, the week after Mr. Mortons on-the-lam interview. Though Ms. Morton promised the court she would have no contact with her fugitive husband, the couple rendezvoused at a hotel just outside Palm Springs. That morning, after the moon briefly blotted out the sun, Mr. Morton was lounging poolside in swim trunks, purple mountains arrayed above him, eclipse glasses at his side. An I.R.S. agent walked up. It was over.At their sentencing, Ms. Morton distanced herself from him. I am a living embodiment of love is blind, she wrote to the judge. If I ever questioned the teachings and processes by others, I was told, who was I to question others who were far smarter than I? There were thousands of attendees to the workshops and seminars. It was so convincing, well-organized and very believable. How could thousands of people be wrong? She was sentenced to two years in prison and has filed an appeal. Behind bars, she passed time taking classes rsum-writing, watercolor-painting, embroidery and watching the Food Network; she was recently transferred to a halfway house. Emails posted on the Project Camelot site suggest she and her husband are still in touch.Mr. Morton was sentenced to six years in prison. Hes representing himself on appeal, and in court papers he argued that hed been improperly profiled as a terrorist sovereign citizen. On Project Camelot, hes unrepentant even sharing a pardon request he said he sent to President Trump.Its because of my work in RADIO and TV INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM that DEEP STATE forces within the D.O.J. put my wife and I in prison for YEARS! he wrote. Of course, he had a suggestion for how to correct this injustice: donate to his PayPal account. ",

          "By the time that Felix Eberty, a German jurist and amateur astronomer, anonymously published The Stars and World History, in 1846, it was well known that light had a finite speed. Ole Rmer, a Danish scientist working in Paris, had proved as much more than a century and a half earlier. It took the suns rays a little over eight minutes to reach Earth, Jupiters up to fifty-two minutes, and Uranuss more than two and a half hours. Eberty was particularly fascinated by what this delay meant for a faraway observer of our planet. Perched on a distant star, he wrote, such a person might see the earth at this moment as it existed at the time of Abraham. Furthermore, by hopscotching across the cosmos, he will be able to represent to himself, as rapidly as he pleases, that moment in the worlds history which he wishes to observe at leisure. Eberty had witnessed great gains in the speed of transportation and communication during his lifetime, and he believed that humanity might soon be travelling even faster than light.Later authors continued the thought experiment. The French astronomer Camille Flammarion, writing in 1873, envisioned a remote planet with a light-sensitive surface. We may imagine this world to be not spherical but cylindrical, and to stand in space like an imperishable column on which the events of terrestrial history engrave and enroll themselves, he wrote. Lovers separated by time or circumstance could replay the dear scenes they enjoyed together on earth, perhaps including views of very secret things. Criminals would find themselves incapable of eluding justice, because each of their misdeeds would transmit itself eternally into infinity, carried by light. Death would lose its finality; if we wanted, Flammarion suggested, we could watch the Battle of Waterloo in reverse, a Waterloo of the afterlife. The popular-science writer Aaron Bernstein joined in. The great cosmic postal service, he wrote, knew neither past nor present: Alexander the Great is still conquering the world.Among the impressionable young Germans who read Eberty and Bernstein was one named Albert Einstein. (He recalled devouring Bernsteins work, in particular, with breathless attention, and it may have inspired one of the conjectures that led to his special theory of relativity.) Indeed, the older authors had a profound influence on how the physicists ideas about the universe came to be popularized. Einstein put the finishing touches on general relativity, the second part of his grand theory, at the end of 1915, declaring himself contented but kaput. The following year, he embarked on a mission of public education, using fanciful imaginings like those of Eberty and the rest to explain the theory and explore its strange implications. He published a book, Relativity: The Special and General Theory, with the desire that it might, he wrote, bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought. Several years earlier, the French physicist Paul Langevin had delivered a lecture on special relativity in which he asked for an audience volunteer to hop aboard the projectile of Jules Verne and experience time dilation. Einstein chose more familiar conveyances: his stories featured our old friend the railway carriage.In 1919, with some cosmic help from a solar eclipse, the predictions of general relativity were proved valid. New Theory of the Universe, a headline in the London Times crowed. Newtonian Ideas Overthrown. The true meaning and significance of Einsteins theories could now reach a wide audience. Bertrand Russell, a man otherwise known for brilliant but stuffy mathematical and philosophical work, authored The ABC of Relativity, in which dinner plates changed shape, from circular to oval, according to ones perspective, and flies landing on stagnant pools served as models for stars bending space-time. Chief among the relativity evangelists, though, was Arthur Eddington, the straitlaced British astronomer who led the eclipse observations. His stories proved particularly enthralling to the press. A few weeks after the results were announced, he gave a talk at Trinity College, Cambridge, that the New York Times summarized with the headline Professor Eddington, 6 Feet to the Eye, Explains How It May Be Really Only 3 Feet. A year later, in Space, Time and Gravitation, he asked readers to imagine an aviator travelling at a hundred and sixty-one thousand miles per second, almost nine-tenths the speed of light. The pilots watch would seem, to a terrestrial observer, to tick twice as slowly; his cigar would seem to burn twice as long. Then, in another lecture to university students, Eddington invoked star-crossed lovers, just as Flammarion had:Suppose that you are in love with a lady on Neptune and that she returns the sentiment. It will be some consolation for the melancholy separation if you can say to yourself at somepossibly prearrangedmoment, She is thinking of me now. Unfortunately a difficulty has arisen because we have had to abolish Now She will have to think of you continuously for eight hours on end in order to circumvent the ambiguity of Now.Many readers swallowed relativity stories as quickly as they could be printed, but the French philosopher Henri Bergson, who had attended Langevins relativity lecture years earlier, was profoundly irritated by scientists growing prominence as public intellectuals. The philosopher had been, until then, more famous than Einstein, known for having launched his own Copernican revolution (as William James put it), which introduced a notion of time that could not be reduced to clocks. Einstein and Bergson quibbled with each others views for the rest of their lives. The physicists talent, the philosopher implied, was not so different from that of H. G. Wells, whose novel The Time Machine had considered time as a fourth dimension, just as general relativity did; perhaps both fascinated the public because of their fictional qualities more than their scientific ones. Relativity enthusiasts, he argued, should be careful to distinguish the real from the symbolic, to avoid elevating a mathematical representation into transcendental reality. They should go back to the original equations and seek to connect them to the really realin other words, that which could actually be perceived. Nowhere could the philosopher find cigar-smoking aviators or transplanetary love stories.Bergsons objections were partly responsible for one of the most enduring curiosities of modern scientific history, which is that Einstein never won a Nobel Prize for his work on relativity. Rather, he received the award for his discovery of the photoelectric effect (itself no small feat). Svante Arrhenius, the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, began his presentation speech, in late 1922, by putting relativity to one side:There is probably no physicist living today whose name has become so widely known as that of Albert Einstein. Most discussion centers on his theory of relativity. . . . It will be no secret that the famous philosopher Bergson in Paris has challenged this theory, while other philosophers have acclaimed it wholeheartedly. The theory in question also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time.The jury, in other words, was still out.Einstein was not pleased with Bergsons interference. He wrote many letters dismissing the philosophers arguments, but the problem did not seem to go away. The summer after the Nobel Prize fiasco, he made another attempt. The Stars and World History was being republished, and he agreed to write a brief foreword. In it, he praised Eberty, whom he called an original and ingenious person, for questioning the received understanding of timefor grasping, as Einstein had done with relativity, that a seemingly stable feature of reality was neither unidirectional nor absolute. Nevertheless, Einstein wrote, Ebertys visions were so odd that they made his own conception of the universeas a four-dimensional structure that is both space and time, and that curves in response to matterseem reasonable by comparison. The book, he concluded, showed how the theory of relativity, itself often accused of leading to bizarre conclusions, can in fact save us from some very peculiar ones. The truth of the cosmos was only a little less strange than science fiction. ",
          "“New Theory of the Universe,” a headline in the London Times crowed. “Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.” For a introductory but fascinating treatment of why this is wrong you should read Asimov's <i>The Relativity of Wrong</i> (<a href=\"https://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/RelativityofWrong.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/RelativityofWrong.ht...</a>) In fact, this should be required reading for science journalists, which, by the looks of the current writing, is not the case.<p>Sad to read that the Nobel committee was so influenced by Henri Bergson's baseless objections.

        "url_text": "By the time that Felix Eberty, a German jurist and amateur astronomer, anonymously published The Stars and World History, in 1846, it was well known that light had a finite speed. Ole Rmer, a Danish scientist working in Paris, had proved as much more than a century and a half earlier. It took the suns rays a little over eight minutes to reach Earth, Jupiters up to fifty-two minutes, and Uranuss more than two and a half hours. Eberty was particularly fascinated by what this delay meant for a faraway observer of our planet. Perched on a distant star, he wrote, such a person might see the earth at this moment as it existed at the time of Abraham. Furthermore, by hopscotching across the cosmos, he will be able to represent to himself, as rapidly as he pleases, that moment in the worlds history which he wishes to observe at leisure. Eberty had witnessed great gains in the speed of transportation and communication during his lifetime, and he believed that humanity might soon be travelling even faster than light.Later authors continued the thought experiment. The French astronomer Camille Flammarion, writing in 1873, envisioned a remote planet with a light-sensitive surface. We may imagine this world to be not spherical but cylindrical, and to stand in space like an imperishable column on which the events of terrestrial history engrave and enroll themselves, he wrote. Lovers separated by time or circumstance could replay the dear scenes they enjoyed together on earth, perhaps including views of very secret things. Criminals would find themselves incapable of eluding justice, because each of their misdeeds would transmit itself eternally into infinity, carried by light. Death would lose its finality; if we wanted, Flammarion suggested, we could watch the Battle of Waterloo in reverse, a Waterloo of the afterlife. The popular-science writer Aaron Bernstein joined in. The great cosmic postal service, he wrote, knew neither past nor present: Alexander the Great is still conquering the world.Among the impressionable young Germans who read Eberty and Bernstein was one named Albert Einstein. (He recalled devouring Bernsteins work, in particular, with breathless attention, and it may have inspired one of the conjectures that led to his special theory of relativity.) Indeed, the older authors had a profound influence on how the physicists ideas about the universe came to be popularized. Einstein put the finishing touches on general relativity, the second part of his grand theory, at the end of 1915, declaring himself contented but kaput. The following year, he embarked on a mission of public education, using fanciful imaginings like those of Eberty and the rest to explain the theory and explore its strange implications. He published a book, Relativity: The Special and General Theory, with the desire that it might, he wrote, bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought. Several years earlier, the French physicist Paul Langevin had delivered a lecture on special relativity in which he asked for an audience volunteer to hop aboard the projectile of Jules Verne and experience time dilation. Einstein chose more familiar conveyances: his stories featured our old friend the railway carriage.In 1919, with some cosmic help from a solar eclipse, the predictions of general relativity were proved valid. New Theory of the Universe, a headline in the London Times crowed. Newtonian Ideas Overthrown. The true meaning and significance of Einsteins theories could now reach a wide audience. Bertrand Russell, a man otherwise known for brilliant but stuffy mathematical and philosophical work, authored The ABC of Relativity, in which dinner plates changed shape, from circular to oval, according to ones perspective, and flies landing on stagnant pools served as models for stars bending space-time. Chief among the relativity evangelists, though, was Arthur Eddington, the straitlaced British astronomer who led the eclipse observations. His stories proved particularly enthralling to the press. A few weeks after the results were announced, he gave a talk at Trinity College, Cambridge, that the New York Times summarized with the headline Professor Eddington, 6 Feet to the Eye, Explains How It May Be Really Only 3 Feet. A year later, in Space, Time and Gravitation, he asked readers to imagine an aviator travelling at a hundred and sixty-one thousand miles per second, almost nine-tenths the speed of light. The pilots watch would seem, to a terrestrial observer, to tick twice as slowly; his cigar would seem to burn twice as long. Then, in another lecture to university students, Eddington invoked star-crossed lovers, just as Flammarion had:Suppose that you are in love with a lady on Neptune and that she returns the sentiment. It will be some consolation for the melancholy separation if you can say to yourself at somepossibly prearrangedmoment, She is thinking of me now. Unfortunately a difficulty has arisen because we have had to abolish Now She will have to think of you continuously for eight hours on end in order to circumvent the ambiguity of Now.Many readers swallowed relativity stories as quickly as they could be printed, but the French philosopher Henri Bergson, who had attended Langevins relativity lecture years earlier, was profoundly irritated by scientists growing prominence as public intellectuals. The philosopher had been, until then, more famous than Einstein, known for having launched his own Copernican revolution (as William James put it), which introduced a notion of time that could not be reduced to clocks. Einstein and Bergson quibbled with each others views for the rest of their lives. The physicists talent, the philosopher implied, was not so different from that of H. G. Wells, whose novel The Time Machine had considered time as a fourth dimension, just as general relativity did; perhaps both fascinated the public because of their fictional qualities more than their scientific ones. Relativity enthusiasts, he argued, should be careful to distinguish the real from the symbolic, to avoid elevating a mathematical representation into transcendental reality. They should go back to the original equations and seek to connect them to the really realin other words, that which could actually be perceived. Nowhere could the philosopher find cigar-smoking aviators or transplanetary love stories.Bergsons objections were partly responsible for one of the most enduring curiosities of modern scientific history, which is that Einstein never won a Nobel Prize for his work on relativity. Rather, he received the award for his discovery of the photoelectric effect (itself no small feat). Svante Arrhenius, the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, began his presentation speech, in late 1922, by putting relativity to one side:There is probably no physicist living today whose name has become so widely known as that of Albert Einstein. Most discussion centers on his theory of relativity. . . . It will be no secret that the famous philosopher Bergson in Paris has challenged this theory, while other philosophers have acclaimed it wholeheartedly. The theory in question also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time.The jury, in other words, was still out.Einstein was not pleased with Bergsons interference. He wrote many letters dismissing the philosophers arguments, but the problem did not seem to go away. The summer after the Nobel Prize fiasco, he made another attempt. The Stars and World History was being republished, and he agreed to write a brief foreword. In it, he praised Eberty, whom he called an original and ingenious person, for questioning the received understanding of timefor grasping, as Einstein had done with relativity, that a seemingly stable feature of reality was neither unidirectional nor absolute. Nevertheless, Einstein wrote, Ebertys visions were so odd that they made his own conception of the universeas a four-dimensional structure that is both space and time, and that curves in response to matterseem reasonable by comparison. The book, he concluded, showed how the theory of relativity, itself often accused of leading to bizarre conclusions, can in fact save us from some very peculiar ones. The truth of the cosmos was only a little less strange than science fiction. ",

          "Yay! Im now a Fellow of the ACM. Along with my fellow new inductee Peter Shor, who I hear is a real up-and-comer in the quantum computing field. I will seek to use this awesome responsibility to steer the ACM along the path of good rather than evil. Also, last week, I attended the Q2B conference in San Jose, where a central theme was the outlook for practical quantum computing in the wake of the first clear demonstration of quantum computational supremacy. Thanks to the folks at QC Ware for organizing a fun conference (full disclosure: Im QC Wares Chief Scientific Advisor). Ill have more to say about the actual scientific things discussed at Q2B in future posts. None of that is why youre here, though. Youre here because of the battle over quantum supremacy. A week ago, my good friend and collaborator Zach Weinersmith, of SMBC Comics, put out a cartoon with a dark-curly-haired scientist named Dr. Aaronson, whos revealed on a hot mic to be an evil quantum supremacist. Apparently a rush job, this cartoon is far from Zachs finest work. For one thing, if the character is supposed to be me, why not draw him as me, and if he isnt, why call him Dr. Aaronson? In any case, I learned from talking to Zach that the cartoons timing was purely coincidental: Zach didnt even realize what a hornets-nest he was poking with this. Ever since John Preskill coined it in 2012, quantum supremacy has been an awkward term. Much as I admire John Preskills wisdom, brilliance, generosity, and good sense, in physics as in everything elseyeah, quantum supremacy is not a term I wouldve coined, and its certainly not a hill Id choose to die on. Once it had gained common currency, though, I sort of took a liking to it, mostly because I realized that I could mine it for dark one-liners in my talks. The thinking was: even as white supremacy was making its horrific resurgence in the US and around the world, here we were, physicists and computer scientists and mathematicians of varied skin tones and accents and genders, coming together to pursue a different and better kind of supremacya small reflection of the better world that we still believed was possible. You might say that we were reclaiming the word supremacywhich, after all, just means a state of being supremefor something non-sexist and non-racist and inclusive and good. In the world of 2019, alas, perhaps it was inevitable that people wouldnt leave things there. My first intimation came a month ago, when Leonie Muecksomeone who Id gotten to know and like when she was an editor at Nature handling quantum information papersemailed me about her view that our community should abandon the term quantum supremacy, because of its potential to make women and minorities uncomfortable in our field. She advocated using quantum advantage instead. So I sent Leonie back a friendly reply, explaining that, as the father of a math-loving 6-year-old girl, I understood and shared her concernsbut also, that I didnt know an alternative term that really worked. See, its like this. Preskill meant quantum supremacy to refer to a momentous event that seemed likely to arrive in a matter of years: namely, the moment when programmable quantum computers would first outpace the ability of the fastest classical supercomputers on earth, running the fastest algorithms known by humans, to simulate what the quantum computers were doing (at least on special, contrived problems). And the historic milestone of quantum advantage? It just doesnt sound right. Plus, as many others pointed out, the term quantum advantage is already used to refer to well, quantum advantages, which might fall well short of supremacy. But one could go further. Suppose we did switch to quantum advantage. Couldnt that term, too, remind vulnerable people about the unfair advantages that some groups have over others? Indeed, while advantage is certainly subtler than supremacy, couldnt that make it all the more insidious, and therefore dangerous? Oblivious though I sometimes am, I realized Leonie would be unhappy if I offered that, because of my wholehearted agreement, I would henceforth never again call it quantum supremacy, but only quantum superiority, quantum dominance, or quantum hegemony. But maybe you now see the problem. What word does the English language provide to describe one thing decisively beating or being better than a different thing for some purpose, and which doesnt have unsavory connotations? Ive heard quantum ascendancy, but that makes it sound like were a UFO cultwaiting to ascend, like ytterbium ions caught in a laser beam, to a vast quantum computer in the sky. Ive heard quantum inimitability (that is, inability to imitate using a classical computer), but who can pronounce that? Yesterday, my brilliant former student Ewin Tang (yes, that one) relayed to me a suggestion by Kevin Tian: quantum eclipse (that is, the moment when quantum computers first eclipse classical ones for some task). But would one want to speak of a quantum eclipse experiment? And shouldnt we expect that, the cuter and cleverer the term, the harder it will be to use unironically? In summary, while someone might think of a term so inspired that it immediately supplants quantum supremacy (and while I welcome suggestions), I currently regard it as an open problem. Anyway, evidently dissatisfied with my response, last week Leonie teamed up with 13 others to publish a letter in Nature, which was originally entitled Supremacy is for racistsuse quantum advantage,' but whose title I see has now been changed to the less inflammatory Instead of supremacy use quantum advantage.' Leonies co-signatories included four of my good friends and colleagues: Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Helmut Katzgraber, Anne Broadbent, and Chris Granade (the last of whom got started in the field by helping me edit Quantum Computing Since Democritus). (Update: Leonie pointed me to a longer list of signatories here, at their website called quantumresponsibility.org. A few names that might be known to Shtetl-Optimized readers are Andrew White, David Yonge-Mallo, Debbie Leung, Matt Leifer, Matthias Troyer.) Their letter says: The community claims that quantum supremacy is a technical term with a specified meaning. However, any technical justification for this descriptor could get swamped as it enters the public arena after the intense media coverage of the past few months.In our view, supremacy has overtones of violence, neocolonialism and racism through its association with white supremacy. Inherently violent language has crept into other branches of science as well in human and robotic spaceflight, for example, terms such as conquest, colonization and settlement evoke theterra nulliusarguments of settler colonialism and must be contextualized against ongoing issues of neocolonialism.Instead, quantum computing should be an open arena and an inspiration for a new generation of scientists. When I did an Ask Me Anything session, as the closing event at Q2B, Sarah Kaiser asked me to comment on the Nature petition. So I repeated what Id said in my emailed response to Leonierunning through the problems with each proposed alternative term, talking about the value of reclaiming the word supremacy, and mostly just trying to diffuse the tension by getting everyone laughing together. Sarah later tweeted that she was really disappointed in my response. Then the Wall Street Journal got in on the action, with a brief editorial (warning: paywalled) mocking the Nature petition: There it is, folks: Mankind has hit quantum wokeness. Our species, akin to Schrdingers cat, is simultaneously brilliant and brain-dead. We built a quantum computer and then argued about whether the write-up was linguistically racist.Taken seriously, the renaming game will never end. First put a Sharpie to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal laws trump state laws. Cancel Matt Damon for his 2004 role in The Bourne Supremacy. Make the Air Force give up the term air supremacy. Tell lovers of supreme pizza to quit being so chauvinistic about their toppings. Please inform Motown legend Diana Ross that the Supremes are problematic.The quirks of quantum mechanics, some people argue, are explained by the existence of many universes. How did we get stuck in this one? Steven Pinker also weighed in, with a linguistically-informed tweetstorm: This sounds like something from The Onion but actually appeared in Nature It follows the wokified stigmatization of other innocent words, like House Master (now, at Harvard, Residential Dean) and NIPS (Neural Information Processing Society, now NeurIPS). Its a familiar linguistic phenomenon, a lexical version of Greshams Law: bad meanings drive good ones out of circulation. Examples: the doomed niggardly (no relation to the n-word) and the original senses of cock, ass, prick, pussy, and booty. Still, the prissy banning of words by academics should be resisted. It dumbs down understanding of language: word meanings are conventions, not spells with magical powers, and all words have multiple senses, which are distinguished in context. Also, it makes academia a laughingstock, tars the innocent, and does nothing to combat actual racism & sexism. Others had a stronger reaction. Curtis Yarvin, better known as Mencius Moldbug, is one of the founders of neoreaction (and a significant influence on Steve Bannon, Michael Anton, and other Trumpists). Regulars might remember that Yarvin argued with me in Shtetl-Optimizeds comment section, under a post in which I denounced Trumps travel ban and its effects on my Iranian PhD student. Since then, Yarvin has sent me many emails, which have ranged from long to extremely long, and whose message could be summarized as: [labored breathing] Abandon your liberal Enlightenment pretensions, young Nerdwalker. Come over the Dark Side. After the supremacy is for racists letter came out in Nature, though, Yarvin sent me his shortest email ever. It was simply a link to the letter, along with the comment I knew it would come to this. He meant: What more proof do you need, young Nerdawan, that this performative wokeness is a cancer that will eventually infect everything you valueeven totally apolitical research in quantum information? And by extension, that my whole worldview, which warned of this, is fundamentally correct, while your faith in liberal academia is nave, and will be repaid only with backstabbing? In a subsequent email, Yarvin predicted that in two years, the whole community will be saying quantum advantage instead of quantum supremacy, and in five years Ill be saying quantum advantage too. As Yarvin famously wrote: Cthulhu may swim slowly. But he only swims left. So what do I really think about this epic battle for (and against) supremacy? Truthfully, half of me just wants to switch to quantum advantage right now and be done with it. As I said, I know some of the signatories of the Nature letter to be smart and reasonable and kind. They dont wish to rid the planet of everyone like me. Theyre not Amanda Marcottes or Arthur Chus. Furthermore, theres little I despise more than a meaty scientific debate devolving into a pointless semantic one, with brilliant friend after brilliant friend getting sucked into the vortex (you too?). Im strongly in the Pinkerian camp, which holds that words are just arbitrary designators, devoid of the totemic power to dictate thoughts. So if friends and colleagueseven just a few of themtell me that they find some word I use to be offensive, why not just be a mensch, apologize for any unintended hurt, switch words midsentence, and continue discussing the matter at hand? But then the other half of me wonders: once weve ceded an open-ended veto over technical terms that remind anyone of anything bad, where does it stop? How do we ever certify a word as kosher? At what point do we all get to stop arguing and laugh together? To make this worry concrete, look back at Sarah Kaisers Twitter threadthe one where she expresses disappointment in me. Below her tweet, someone remarks that, besides quantum supremacy, the word ancilla (as in ancilla qubit, a qubit used for intermediate computation or other auxiliary purposes) is problematic as well. Heres Sarahs response: I agree, but I wanted to start by focusing on the obvious one, Its harder for them to object to just one to start with, then once they admit the logic, we can expand the list (What would Curtis Yarvin say about that?) Youre probably now wondering: whats wrong with ancilla? Apparently, in ancient Rome, an ancilla was a female slave, and indeed thats the Latin root of the English adjective ancillary (as in providing support to). I confess that I hadnt known thathad you? Admittedly, once you do know, you might never again look at a Controlled-NOT gatepitilessly flipping an ancilla qubit, subject only to the whims of a nearby control qubitin quite the same way. (Ah, but the ancilla can fight back against her controller! And she doesin the Hadamard basis.) The thing is, if were gonna play this game: what about annihilation operators? Wont those need to be annihilated from physics? And what about unitary matrices? Doesnt their very name negate the multiplicity of perspectives and cultures? What about Diracs oddly-named bra/ket notation, with its limitless potential for puerile jokes, about the bra vectors displaying their contents horizontally and so forth? (Did you smile at that, you hateful pig?) What about daggers? Dont we need a less violent conjugate tranpose? Not to beat a dead horse, but once you hunt for examples, you realize that the whole dictionary is shot through with domination and brutalitythat youd have to massacre the English language to take it out. Theres nothing special about math or physics in this respect. The same half of me also thinks about my friends and colleagues who oppose claims of quantum supremacy, or even the quest for quantum supremacy, on various scientific grounds. I.e., either they dont think that the Google team achieved what it said, or they think that the task wasnt hard enough for classical computers, or they think that the entire goal is misguided or irrelevant or uninteresting. Which is finethese are precisely the arguments we should be havingexcept that Ive personally seen some of my respected colleagues, while arguing for these positions, opportunistically tack on ideological objections to the term quantum supremacy. Just to goose up their case, I guess. And I confess that every time they did this, it made me want to keep saying quantum supremacy from now till the end of timesolely to deny these colleagues a cheap and unearned victory, one they apparently felt they couldnt obtain on the merits alone. I realize that this is childish and irrational. Most of all, though, the half of me that Im talking about thinks about Curtis Yarvin and the Wall Street Journal editorial board, cackling with glee to see their worldview so dramatically confirmedas theatrical wokeness, that self-parodying modern monstrosity, turns its gaze on (of all things) quantum computing research. More red meat to fire up the baseor at least that sliver of the base nerdy enough to care. And the left, as usual, walks right into the trap, sacrificing its credibility with the outside world to pursue a runaway virtue-signaling spiral. The same half of me thinks: do we really want to fight racism and sexism? Then lets work together to assemble a broad coalition that can defeat Trump. And Jair Bolsonaro, and Viktor Orbn, and all the other ghastly manifestations of humanitys collective lizard-brain. Then, if were really fantasizing, we could liberalize the drug laws, and get contraception and loans and education to women in the Third World, and stop the systematic disenfranchisement of black voters, and open up the worlds richer, whiter, and higher-elevation countries to climate refugees, and protect the worlds remaining indigenous lands (those that didnt burn to the ground this year). In this context, the trouble with obsessing over terms like quantum supremacy is not merely that it diverts attention, while contributing nothing to fighting the worlds actual racism and sexism. The trouble is that the obsessions are actually harmful. For they make academicsalong with progressive activistslook silly. They make people think that we must not have meant it when we talked about the existential urgency of climate change and the worlds other crises. They pump oxygen into right-wing echo chambers. But its worse than ridiculous, because of the message that I fear is received by many outside the activists bubble. When you say stuff like [quantum] supremacy is for racists, whats heard might be something more like: Watch your back, you disgusting supremacist. Yes, you. You claim that you mentor women and minorities, donate to good causes, try hard to confront the demons in your own character? Ha! None of that counts for anything with us. Youll never be with-it enough to be our ally, so dont bother trying. Well see to it that youre never safe, not even in the most abstruse and apolitical fields. Well comb through your wordseven words like ancilla qubitlooking for any that we can cast as offensive by our opaque and ever-shifting standards. And once we find some, well have it within our power to end your career, and youll be reduced to groveling that we dont. Remember those popular kids who bullied you in second grade, giving you nightmares of social ostracism that persist to this day? We plan to achieve what even those bullies couldnt: to shame you with the full backing of the modern worlds moral code. See, were the good guys of this story. Its goodness itself thats branding you as racist scum. In short, I claim that the messagenot the message intended, of course, by anyone other than a Chu or a Marcotte or a SneerClubber, but the message receivedis basically a Trump campaign ad. I claim further that our civilizations current self-inflicted catastrophe will endi.e., the believers in science and reason and progress and rule of law will claw their way back to powerwhen, and only when, a generation of activists emerges that understands these dynamics as well as Barack Obama did. Wouldnt it be awesome if, five years from now, I could say to Curtis Yarvin: you were wrong? If I could say to him: my colleagues and I still use the term quantum supremacy whenever we care to, and none of us have been cancelled or ostracized for itso maybe you should revisit your paranoid theories about Cthulhu and the Cathedral and so forth? If I could say: quantum computing researchers now have bigger fish to fry than arguments over wordslike moving beyond quantum supremacy to the first useful quantum simulations, as well as the race for scalability and fault-tolerance? And even: progressive activists now have bigger fish to fry toolike retaking actual power all over the world? Anyway, as I said, thats how half of me feels. The other half is ready to switch to quantum advantage or any other serviceable term and get back to doing science.

        "url_text": "Yay! Im now a Fellow of the ACM. Along with my fellow new inductee Peter Shor, who I hear is a real up-and-comer in the quantum computing field. I will seek to use this awesome responsibility to steer the ACM along the path of good rather than evil. Also, last week, I attended the Q2B conference in San Jose, where a central theme was the outlook for practical quantum computing in the wake of the first clear demonstration of quantum computational supremacy. Thanks to the folks at QC Ware for organizing a fun conference (full disclosure: Im QC Wares Chief Scientific Advisor). Ill have more to say about the actual scientific things discussed at Q2B in future posts. None of that is why youre here, though. Youre here because of the battle over quantum supremacy. A week ago, my good friend and collaborator Zach Weinersmith, of SMBC Comics, put out a cartoon with a dark-curly-haired scientist named Dr. Aaronson, whos revealed on a hot mic to be an evil quantum supremacist. Apparently a rush job, this cartoon is far from Zachs finest work. For one thing, if the character is supposed to be me, why not draw him as me, and if he isnt, why call him Dr. Aaronson? In any case, I learned from talking to Zach that the cartoons timing was purely coincidental: Zach didnt even realize what a hornets-nest he was poking with this. Ever since John Preskill coined it in 2012, quantum supremacy has been an awkward term. Much as I admire John Preskills wisdom, brilliance, generosity, and good sense, in physics as in everything elseyeah, quantum supremacy is not a term I wouldve coined, and its certainly not a hill Id choose to die on. Once it had gained common currency, though, I sort of took a liking to it, mostly because I realized that I could mine it for dark one-liners in my talks. The thinking was: even as white supremacy was making its horrific resurgence in the US and around the world, here we were, physicists and computer scientists and mathematicians of varied skin tones and accents and genders, coming together to pursue a different and better kind of supremacya small reflection of the better world that we still believed was possible. You might say that we were reclaiming the word supremacywhich, after all, just means a state of being supremefor something non-sexist and non-racist and inclusive and good. In the world of 2019, alas, perhaps it was inevitable that people wouldnt leave things there. My first intimation came a month ago, when Leonie Muecksomeone who Id gotten to know and like when she was an editor at Nature handling quantum information papersemailed me about her view that our community should abandon the term quantum supremacy, because of its potential to make women and minorities uncomfortable in our field. She advocated using quantum advantage instead. So I sent Leonie back a friendly reply, explaining that, as the father of a math-loving 6-year-old girl, I understood and shared her concernsbut also, that I didnt know an alternative term that really worked. See, its like this. Preskill meant quantum supremacy to refer to a momentous event that seemed likely to arrive in a matter of years: namely, the moment when programmable quantum computers would first outpace the ability of the fastest classical supercomputers on earth, running the fastest algorithms known by humans, to simulate what the quantum computers were doing (at least on special, contrived problems). And the historic milestone of quantum advantage? It just doesnt sound right. Plus, as many others pointed out, the term quantum advantage is already used to refer to well, quantum advantages, which might fall well short of supremacy. But one could go further. Suppose we did switch to quantum advantage. Couldnt that term, too, remind vulnerable people about the unfair advantages that some groups have over others? Indeed, while advantage is certainly subtler than supremacy, couldnt that make it all the more insidious, and therefore dangerous? Oblivious though I sometimes am, I realized Leonie would be unhappy if I offered that, because of my wholehearted agreement, I would henceforth never again call it quantum supremacy, but only quantum superiority, quantum dominance, or quantum hegemony. But maybe you now see the problem. What word does the English language provide to describe one thing decisively beating or being better than a different thing for some purpose, and which doesnt have unsavory connotations? Ive heard quantum ascendancy, but that makes it sound like were a UFO cultwaiting to ascend, like ytterbium ions caught in a laser beam, to a vast quantum computer in the sky. Ive heard quantum inimitability (that is, inability to imitate using a classical computer), but who can pronounce that? Yesterday, my brilliant former student Ewin Tang (yes, that one) relayed to me a suggestion by Kevin Tian: quantum eclipse (that is, the moment when quantum computers first eclipse classical ones for some task). But would one want to speak of a quantum eclipse experiment? And shouldnt we expect that, the cuter and cleverer the term, the harder it will be to use unironically? In summary, while someone might think of a term so inspired that it immediately supplants quantum supremacy (and while I welcome suggestions), I currently regard it as an open problem. Anyway, evidently dissatisfied with my response, last week Leonie teamed up with 13 others to publish a letter in Nature, which was originally entitled Supremacy is for racistsuse quantum advantage,' but whose title I see has now been changed to the less inflammatory Instead of supremacy use quantum advantage.' Leonies co-signatories included four of my good friends and colleagues: Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Helmut Katzgraber, Anne Broadbent, and Chris Granade (the last of whom got started in the field by helping me edit Quantum Computing Since Democritus). (Update: Leonie pointed me to a longer list of signatories here, at their website called quantumresponsibility.org. A few names that might be known to Shtetl-Optimized readers are Andrew White, David Yonge-Mallo, Debbie Leung, Matt Leifer, Matthias Troyer.) Their letter says: The community claims that quantum supremacy is a technical term with a specified meaning. However, any technical justification for this descriptor could get swamped as it enters the public arena after the intense media coverage of the past few months.In our view, supremacy has overtones of violence, neocolonialism and racism through its association with white supremacy. Inherently violent language has crept into other branches of science as well in human and robotic spaceflight, for example, terms such as conquest, colonization and settlement evoke theterra nulliusarguments of settler colonialism and must be contextualized against ongoing issues of neocolonialism.Instead, quantum computing should be an open arena and an inspiration for a new generation of scientists. When I did an Ask Me Anything session, as the closing event at Q2B, Sarah Kaiser asked me to comment on the Nature petition. So I repeated what Id said in my emailed response to Leonierunning through the problems with each proposed alternative term, talking about the value of reclaiming the word supremacy, and mostly just trying to diffuse the tension by getting everyone laughing together. Sarah later tweeted that she was really disappointed in my response. Then the Wall Street Journal got in on the action, with a brief editorial (warning: paywalled) mocking the Nature petition: There it is, folks: Mankind has hit quantum wokeness. Our species, akin to Schrdingers cat, is simultaneously brilliant and brain-dead. We built a quantum computer and then argued about whether the write-up was linguistically racist.Taken seriously, the renaming game will never end. First put a Sharpie to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal laws trump state laws. Cancel Matt Damon for his 2004 role in The Bourne Supremacy. Make the Air Force give up the term air supremacy. Tell lovers of supreme pizza to quit being so chauvinistic about their toppings. Please inform Motown legend Diana Ross that the Supremes are problematic.The quirks of quantum mechanics, some people argue, are explained by the existence of many universes. How did we get stuck in this one? Steven Pinker also weighed in, with a linguistically-informed tweetstorm: This sounds like something from The Onion but actually appeared in Nature It follows the wokified stigmatization of other innocent words, like House Master (now, at Harvard, Residential Dean) and NIPS (Neural Information Processing Society, now NeurIPS). Its a familiar linguistic phenomenon, a lexical version of Greshams Law: bad meanings drive good ones out of circulation. Examples: the doomed niggardly (no relation to the n-word) and the original senses of cock, ass, prick, pussy, and booty. Still, the prissy banning of words by academics should be resisted. It dumbs down understanding of language: word meanings are conventions, not spells with magical powers, and all words have multiple senses, which are distinguished in context. Also, it makes academia a laughingstock, tars the innocent, and does nothing to combat actual racism & sexism. Others had a stronger reaction. Curtis Yarvin, better known as Mencius Moldbug, is one of the founders of neoreaction (and a significant influence on Steve Bannon, Michael Anton, and other Trumpists). Regulars might remember that Yarvin argued with me in Shtetl-Optimizeds comment section, under a post in which I denounced Trumps travel ban and its effects on my Iranian PhD student. Since then, Yarvin has sent me many emails, which have ranged from long to extremely long, and whose message could be summarized as: [labored breathing] Abandon your liberal Enlightenment pretensions, young Nerdwalker. Come over the Dark Side. After the supremacy is for racists letter came out in Nature, though, Yarvin sent me his shortest email ever. It was simply a link to the letter, along with the comment I knew it would come to this. He meant: What more proof do you need, young Nerdawan, that this performative wokeness is a cancer that will eventually infect everything you valueeven totally apolitical research in quantum information? And by extension, that my whole worldview, which warned of this, is fundamentally correct, while your faith in liberal academia is nave, and will be repaid only with backstabbing? In a subsequent email, Yarvin predicted that in two years, the whole community will be saying quantum advantage instead of quantum supremacy, and in five years Ill be saying quantum advantage too. As Yarvin famously wrote: Cthulhu may swim slowly. But he only swims left. So what do I really think about this epic battle for (and against) supremacy? Truthfully, half of me just wants to switch to quantum advantage right now and be done with it. As I said, I know some of the signatories of the Nature letter to be smart and reasonable and kind. They dont wish to rid the planet of everyone like me. Theyre not Amanda Marcottes or Arthur Chus. Furthermore, theres little I despise more than a meaty scientific debate devolving into a pointless semantic one, with brilliant friend after brilliant friend getting sucked into the vortex (you too?). Im strongly in the Pinkerian camp, which holds that words are just arbitrary designators, devoid of the totemic power to dictate thoughts. So if friends and colleagueseven just a few of themtell me that they find some word I use to be offensive, why not just be a mensch, apologize for any unintended hurt, switch words midsentence, and continue discussing the matter at hand? But then the other half of me wonders: once weve ceded an open-ended veto over technical terms that remind anyone of anything bad, where does it stop? How do we ever certify a word as kosher? At what point do we all get to stop arguing and laugh together? To make this worry concrete, look back at Sarah Kaisers Twitter threadthe one where she expresses disappointment in me. Below her tweet, someone remarks that, besides quantum supremacy, the word ancilla (as in ancilla qubit, a qubit used for intermediate computation or other auxiliary purposes) is problematic as well. Heres Sarahs response: I agree, but I wanted to start by focusing on the obvious one, Its harder for them to object to just one to start with, then once they admit the logic, we can expand the list (What would Curtis Yarvin say about that?) Youre probably now wondering: whats wrong with ancilla? Apparently, in ancient Rome, an ancilla was a female slave, and indeed thats the Latin root of the English adjective ancillary (as in providing support to). I confess that I hadnt known thathad you? Admittedly, once you do know, you might never again look at a Controlled-NOT gatepitilessly flipping an ancilla qubit, subject only to the whims of a nearby control qubitin quite the same way. (Ah, but the ancilla can fight back against her controller! And she doesin the Hadamard basis.) The thing is, if were gonna play this game: what about annihilation operators? Wont those need to be annihilated from physics? And what about unitary matrices? Doesnt their very name negate the multiplicity of perspectives and cultures? What about Diracs oddly-named bra/ket notation, with its limitless potential for puerile jokes, about the bra vectors displaying their contents horizontally and so forth? (Did you smile at that, you hateful pig?) What about daggers? Dont we need a less violent conjugate tranpose? Not to beat a dead horse, but once you hunt for examples, you realize that the whole dictionary is shot through with domination and brutalitythat youd have to massacre the English language to take it out. Theres nothing special about math or physics in this respect. The same half of me also thinks about my friends and colleagues who oppose claims of quantum supremacy, or even the quest for quantum supremacy, on various scientific grounds. I.e., either they dont think that the Google team achieved what it said, or they think that the task wasnt hard enough for classical computers, or they think that the entire goal is misguided or irrelevant or uninteresting. Which is finethese are precisely the arguments we should be havingexcept that Ive personally seen some of my respected colleagues, while arguing for these positions, opportunistically tack on ideological objections to the term quantum supremacy. Just to goose up their case, I guess. And I confess that every time they did this, it made me want to keep saying quantum supremacy from now till the end of timesolely to deny these colleagues a cheap and unearned victory, one they apparently felt they couldnt obtain on the merits alone. I realize that this is childish and irrational. Most of all, though, the half of me that Im talking about thinks about Curtis Yarvin and the Wall Street Journal editorial board, cackling with glee to see their worldview so dramatically confirmedas theatrical wokeness, that self-parodying modern monstrosity, turns its gaze on (of all things) quantum computing research. More red meat to fire up the baseor at least that sliver of the base nerdy enough to care. And the left, as usual, walks right into the trap, sacrificing its credibility with the outside world to pursue a runaway virtue-signaling spiral. The same half of me thinks: do we really want to fight racism and sexism? Then lets work together to assemble a broad coalition that can defeat Trump. And Jair Bolsonaro, and Viktor Orbn, and all the other ghastly manifestations of humanitys collective lizard-brain. Then, if were really fantasizing, we could liberalize the drug laws, and get contraception and loans and education to women in the Third World, and stop the systematic disenfranchisement of black voters, and open up the worlds richer, whiter, and higher-elevation countries to climate refugees, and protect the worlds remaining indigenous lands (those that didnt burn to the ground this year).

          "Hubble takes gigantic image of the Triangulum Galaxy",
          "https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1901/",
          "heic1901 Photo Release 7 January 2019 The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has captured the most detailed image yet of a close neighbour of the Milky Way the Triangulum Galaxy, a spiral galaxy located at a distance of only three million light-years. This panoramic survey of the third-largest galaxy in our Local Group of galaxies provides a mesmerising view of the 40 billion stars that make up one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye. This new image of the Triangulum Galaxy also known as Messier 33 or NGC 598 has a staggering 665 million pixels and showcases the central region of the galaxy and its inner spiral arms. To stitch together this gigantic mosaic, Hubbles Advanced Camera for Surveys needed to create 54 separate images. Under excellent dark-sky conditions, the Triangulum Galaxy can be seen with the naked eye as a faint, blurry object in the constellation of Triangulum (the Triangle), where its ethereal glow is an exciting target for amateur astronomers. At only three million light-years from Earth, the Triangulum Galaxy is a notable member of the Local Group it is the groups third-largest galaxy, but also the smallest spiral galaxy in the group [1]. It measures only about 60 000 light-years across, compared to the 200 000 light-years of the Andromeda Galaxy; the Milky Way lies between these extremes at about 100 000 light-years in diameter [2]. The Triangulum Galaxy is not only surpassed in size by the other two spirals, but by the multitude of stars they contain. The Triangulum Galaxy has at least an order of magnitude less stars than the Milky Way and two orders of magnitude less than Andromeda. These numbers are hard to grasp when already in this image 10 to 15 million individual stars are visible. In contrast to the two larger spirals, the Triangulum Galaxy doesnt have a bright bulge at its centre and it also lacks a bar connecting its spiral arms to the centre. It does, however, contain a huge amount of gas and dust, giving rise to rapid star formation. New stars form at a rate of approximately one solar mass every two years. The abundance of gas clouds in the Triangulum Galaxy is precisely what drew astronomers to conduct this detailed survey. When stars are born, they use up material in these clouds of gas and dust, leaving less fuel for new stars to emerge. Hubbles image shows two of the four brightest of these regions in the galaxy: NGC 595 and NGC 604. The latter is the second most luminous region of ionised hydrogen within the Local Group and it is also among the largest known star formation regions in the Local Group. These detailed observations of the Triangulum Galaxy have tremendous legacy value combined with those of the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy and the irregular Magellanic Cloud galaxies, they will help astronomers to better understand star formation and stellar evolution. Notes[1] Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is part of the Local Group, an assembly of more than 50 galaxies bound together by gravity. Its largest member is the Andromeda Galaxy also known as Messier 31 followed by the Milky Way and the Triangulum Galaxy. The remaining members of the Local Group are dwarf galaxies, each orbiting one of the three larger ones. [2] The much bigger Andromeda Galaxy was mapped by Hubble in 2015, creating the sharpest and largest image of this galaxy and the largest Hubble image ever (heic1502).

        "url_text": "heic1901 Photo Release 7 January 2019 The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has captured the most detailed image yet of a close neighbour of the Milky Way the Triangulum Galaxy, a spiral galaxy located at a distance of only three million light-years. This panoramic survey of the third-largest galaxy in our Local Group of galaxies provides a mesmerising view of the 40 billion stars that make up one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye. This new image of the Triangulum Galaxy also known as Messier 33 or NGC 598 has a staggering 665 million pixels and showcases the central region of the galaxy and its inner spiral arms. To stitch together this gigantic mosaic, Hubbles Advanced Camera for Surveys needed to create 54 separate images. Under excellent dark-sky conditions, the Triangulum Galaxy can be seen with the naked eye as a faint, blurry object in the constellation of Triangulum (the Triangle), where its ethereal glow is an exciting target for amateur astronomers. At only three million light-years from Earth, the Triangulum Galaxy is a notable member of the Local Group it is the groups third-largest galaxy, but also the smallest spiral galaxy in the group [1]. It measures only about 60 000 light-years across, compared to the 200 000 light-years of the Andromeda Galaxy; the Milky Way lies between these extremes at about 100 000 light-years in diameter [2]. The Triangulum Galaxy is not only surpassed in size by the other two spirals, but by the multitude of stars they contain. The Triangulum Galaxy has at least an order of magnitude less stars than the Milky Way and two orders of magnitude less than Andromeda. These numbers are hard to grasp when already in this image 10 to 15 million individual stars are visible. In contrast to the two larger spirals, the Triangulum Galaxy doesnt have a bright bulge at its centre and it also lacks a bar connecting its spiral arms to the centre. It does, however, contain a huge amount of gas and dust, giving rise to rapid star formation. New stars form at a rate of approximately one solar mass every two years. The abundance of gas clouds in the Triangulum Galaxy is precisely what drew astronomers to conduct this detailed survey. When stars are born, they use up material in these clouds of gas and dust, leaving less fuel for new stars to emerge. Hubbles image shows two of the four brightest of these regions in the galaxy: NGC 595 and NGC 604. The latter is the second most luminous region of ionised hydrogen within the Local Group and it is also among the largest known star formation regions in the Local Group. These detailed observations of the Triangulum Galaxy have tremendous legacy value combined with those of the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy and the irregular Magellanic Cloud galaxies, they will help astronomers to better understand star formation and stellar evolution. Notes[1] Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is part of the Local Group, an assembly of more than 50 galaxies bound together by gravity. Its largest member is the Andromeda Galaxy also known as Messier 31 followed by the Milky Way and the Triangulum Galaxy. The remaining members of the Local Group are dwarf galaxies, each orbiting one of the three larger ones. [2] The much bigger Andromeda Galaxy was mapped by Hubble in 2015, creating the sharpest and largest image of this galaxy and the largest Hubble image ever (heic1502).

          "More than 31,000 homes across the country were rented out so often on Airbnb in 2018 that they were likely removed from the long-term rental supply, according to a groundbreaking study by McGill University researchers.Put another way, thats more than enough homes for everyone in North Vancouver.As the popularity of short-term rentals has soared, the effect on rental supply in Canadas cities, towns and rural areas has grown, according to the study. Shared exclusively with The Globe and Mail, the report is the most comprehensive analysis of Airbnbs impact to date, and reveals the extent of the global rental services footprint, even as local officials implement rules that target the short-term rental industry.How small Canadian towns are grappling with Airbnbs explosive growthMunicipalities raise housing affordability concerns after study outlines Airbnbs impact on long-term rental marketsThose 31,000 homes are equal to about 1.5 per cent of residences across the country that have been built for the rental market.Airbnb and similar platforms are among several factors, including a lack of rental construction and high barriers to home ownership, that have affected rental markets. Housing advocates say not enough rental housing is being built in Canadas largest cities to accommodate population growth.In 2018, the platform had a daily average of 128,000 active listings in Canada, which includes everything from a basement suite to a lakefront cottage, an increase of 25 per cent from 2017, according to the report. And for hosts, its been a profitable time: They brought in $1.8-billion in revenue last year, up 40 per cent from 2017.Many people believe that they interact with these services mainly as guests, said David Wachsmuth, a McGill professor and one of the reports co-authors. What my research has been showing is that, actually, we interact with short-term rentals every day of our lives in a different way theyre having rather large impacts on our housing markets.In the past, Prof. Wachsmuth has done consulting work and produced reports for governments, and civic and business groups, including a hotel-industry association. This study, which has been peer reviewed, was funded solely by the federal government, however.David Wachsmuth, Canada Research Chair in Urban Governance, poses in Le Plateau, a neighbourhood where Airbnbs are becoming more prevalent, in Montreal, on June 14, 2019.Christinne Muschi/The Globe and MailOver the past decade, short-term rentals have become increasingly popular. Sites such as Airbnb, HomeAway and VRBO have developed into global platforms, allowing people to rent out spare rooms or entire homes to travellers, with a cut going to the company.When you offer your place as a short-term rental, you have more control over it, you can use it for yourself whenever you want, [and] it makes more money than renting to long-term tenants, said Dany Papineau, who operates four listings at two properties he co-owns, one in Montreal and another in the Eastern Townships, about 90 minutes east of the city. Personally, Im not interested in doing long-term rentals at all, he said.As short-term rental activity has grown globally, regulators in many of the worlds tourist hubs Barcelona, New York, Amsterdam, Los Angeles are cracking down on short-term rentals, citing concerns over distortions to the local housing supply and lost tax revenue, along with a host of other issues.In New York, for instance, Airbnb directly accounted for a US$380 increase in median annual rent costs, according to a separate report from Prof. Wachsmuth last year that was funded, in part, by a hotel-industry organization. The more Airbnb activity you see in a city, the higher housing prices and the higher rents are going to get, he said. Theres no question that [Canadian] cities are now past that point.Within Canada, short-term rental activity is highly concentrated in a few cities. The Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver areas accounted for close to half of Canadas average daily listings in 2018, and hosts there brought in $710-million, up 27 per cent from 2017. Theyre also where the most rental supply is under threat: Forty per cent of the roughly 31,000 homes that were frequently rented last year were found in those cities, amounting to more than 12,000 lost housing units. Hosts of those units brought in $374-million, up 30 per cent from 2017.Its a relatively significant number, said Graham Haines, research manager at the Ryerson City Building Institute, of the total number of frequently rented homes. Between the Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver areas, thats almost enough housing to add a whole percentage point back onto our vacancy rates, he added.Vacancy rates for purpose-built apartments in the Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver areas were 1.9 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, in 2018, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. all below historical norms. Over the past five years, Toronto has added 18 times more condominium units (80,000) than purpose-built rentals (4,500 units), according to a city report from January.When asked about the studys findings, Airbnb said it takes housing affordability seriously. In Canadian cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, theres no question theyre facing real housing challenges, said Alex Dagg, director of public policy at Airbnb Canada.Ms. Dagg contested the McGill teams findings, saying they are based only on publicly accessible information collected from Airbnbs website. For instance, she said that when an Airbnb unit is unavailable for bookings, researchers would be unable to fully ascertain whether it is occupied by its owner rather than a guest.We dont agree with the validity of that number, Ms. Dagg said of the reports finding that 31,000 homes were frequently rented. She also disagreed that Airbnb was having an impact on rental housing. [They have] no way of knowing those houses or those units would ever be on the long-term rental market, she said.To calculate lost housing numbers, the McGill team looked for entire-home listings available for rent at least half the year, and actually rented at least 90 nights. According to the study, any home thats listed for a majority of the year likely doesnt house a long-term resident.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: MCGILL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF URBAN PLANNING There are people who are being evicted from their apartment buildings to convert those units into Airbnbs, Prof. Wachsmuth said. Thats a fact right now.The McGill authors note that frequently rented homes are still a small fraction of total housing in any Canadian city. However, listings can be highly concentrated in some neighbourhoods. In parts of Montreal, for instance, one in five homes were listed on Airbnb.As short-term rental platforms continue to grow, policy-makers have started to respond.In 2016, Quebec became the first major Canadian jurisdiction to regulate the short-term rental industry, requiring some hosts to obtain permits. Vancouvers rules went into effect last year, and only allow short-term rentals in a hosts principal residence. Toronto has passed its own regime, although zoning amendments are tied up in appeals proceedings, with a hearing set for August.Enforcement has proved tricky, however. In the early days of Quebecs regulations, virtually no hosts were complying, Prof. Wachsmuth said. The province later shifted enforcement to its revenue department, giving it expanded powers to target wrongdoers. Still, just two weeks ago, Quebec overhauled its rules again.Well find them, and well fine them, Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx said of rule-breaking hosts.Despite provincial regulations, Airbnb has continued rapidly growing in Montreal, fuelled by the outsize impact of another nationwide trend: the rise of hyperactive, professional hosts who manage several listings.Nearly half of all Canadian Airbnb revenue in 2018 was generated by commercial operators, or those who manage multiple listings, the McGill report said. Their share of sales increased from 2017 in nearly all metro areas. Among this group, there are some hosts that vastly eclipse the competition: Fifteen managed at least 100 active listings apiece in the past year, the report said, and nearly 60 hosts earned more than $1-million in 2018.Canadian cities really stand out when you look around the world, for having their short-term rental market dominated by commercial operators, said Prof. Wachsmuth, whose team has established itself as world leaders in measuring the global impact of Airbnb. Montreal in particular is the worst in the whole world.It vastly differs from how Airbnb often pitches itself: as a personal platform through which residents, either out of town or looking to put a second bedroom to good use, will occasionally rent out their spaces.Often, the largest hosts are in fact businesses that manage vacation rentals on behalf of homeowners. Thats the case for Maryrose Coleman and Ross Halloran, who together run Muskoka District Rentals, a cottage-rental service. They conduct roughly a third of their business on Airbnb.How one Toronto mans mini-empire of Airbnb ghost hotels exacerbates the citys long-term rental marketListing your place on Airbnb can land you in trouble with your mortgage lenderIn Muskoka, Ont., a cottage can easily sell for upward of $2-million, even though it may only be occupied for a few weeks out of the year. These days, if you have a cottage, Mr. Halloran said, its good business to rent it out mitigate the costs, if you can, when youre not using it.Data from the McGill team suggest Muskoka District Rentals is among the largest Airbnb hosts by revenue. As of mid-June, it had 76 listings on the platform.Back in Montreal, more than 30 per cent of the citys Airbnb revenue was generated by 1 per cent of hosts in 2018, and many link the rise of commercialization to lost housing supply.City councillor Richard Ryan estimates that a couple of thousand units in the citys central areas were lost to commercial operators. He was a driving force behind new bylaws in the Plateau-Mont-Royal and Ville-Marie boroughs, where listings can be restricted to particular streets.Beyond questions over supply, short-term rentals are roiling communities in other ways. These issues are significantly affecting the quality of life in the neighbourhood: noise, parties at any time of day or night, safety concerns, garbage strewn out on the street, a lack of respect for neighbours and so on, Mr. Ryan said via e-mail.Even with new regulations in place, there remain broad swaths of the country from big cities such as Calgary, to small communities in Ontarios cottage country where short-term rentals are subject to few restrictions, if any at all. As such, Prof. Wachsmuth expects Airbnb to continue growing, given that Canada is less of a mature market than the United States.Even then, he is near certain his research is still underestimating the size of the short-term rental market in Canada. But, he notes that the Canadian market has hit a turning point.Airbnb, HomeAway and other companies in the sector enjoyed a period of several years where policy-makers werent really paying attention, he said. I think that period is over now. ",

THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: MCGILL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF URBAN PLANNING There are people who are being evicted from their apartment buildings to convert those units into Airbnbs, Prof. Wachsmuth said. Thats a fact right now.The McGill authors note that frequently rented homes are still a small fraction of total housing in any Canadian city. However, listings can be highly concentrated in some neighbourhoods. In parts of Montreal, for instance, one in five homes were listed on Airbnb.As short-term rental platforms continue to grow, policy-makers have started to respond.In 2016, Quebec became the first major Canadian jurisdiction to regulate the short-term rental industry, requiring some hosts to obtain permits. Vancouvers rules went into effect last year, and only allow short-term rentals in a hosts principal residence. Toronto has passed its own regime, although zoning amendments are tied up in appeals proceedings, with a hearing set for August.Enforcement has proved tricky, however. In the early days of Quebecs regulations, virtually no hosts were complying, Prof. Wachsmuth said. The province later shifted enforcement to its revenue department, giving it expanded powers to target wrongdoers. Still, just two weeks ago, Quebec overhauled its rules again.Well find them, and well fine them, Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx said of rule-breaking hosts.Despite provincial regulations, Airbnb has continued rapidly growing in Montreal, fuelled by the outsize impact of another nationwide trend: the rise of hyperactive, professional hosts who manage several listings.Nearly half of all Canadian Airbnb revenue in 2018 was generated by commercial operators, or those who manage multiple listings, the McGill report said. Their share of sales increased from 2017 in nearly all metro areas. Among this group, there are some hosts that vastly eclipse the competition: Fifteen managed at least 100 active listings apiece in the past year, the report said, and nearly 60 hosts earned more than $1-million in 2018.Canadian cities really stand out when you look around the world, for having their short-term rental market dominated by commercial operators, said Prof. Wachsmuth, whose team has established itself as world leaders in measuring the global impact of Airbnb. Montreal in particular is the worst in the whole world.It vastly differs from how Airbnb often pitches itself: as a personal platform through which residents, either out of town or looking to put a second bedroom to good use, will occasionally rent out their spaces.Often, the largest hosts are in fact businesses that manage vacation rentals on behalf of homeowners. Thats the case for Maryrose Coleman and Ross Halloran, who together run Muskoka District Rentals, a cottage-rental service. They conduct roughly a third of their business on Airbnb.How one Toronto mans mini-empire of Airbnb ghost hotels exacerbates the citys long-term rental marketListing your place on Airbnb can land you in trouble with your mortgage lenderIn Muskoka, Ont., a cottage can easily sell for upward of $2-million, even though it may only be occupied for a few weeks out of the year. These days, if you have a cottage, Mr. Halloran said, its good business to rent it out mitigate the costs, if you can, when youre not using it.Data from the McGill team suggest Muskoka District Rentals is among the largest Airbnb hosts by revenue. As of mid-June, it had 76 listings on the platform.Back in Montreal, more than 30 per cent of the citys Airbnb revenue was generated by 1 per cent of hosts in 2018, and many link the rise of commercialization to lost housing supply.City councillor Richard Ryan estimates that a couple of thousand units in the citys central areas were lost to commercial operators. He was a driving force behind new bylaws in the Plateau-Mont-Royal and Ville-Marie boroughs, where listings can be restricted to particular streets.Beyond questions over supply, short-term rentals are roiling communities in other ways. These issues are significantly affecting the quality of life in the neighbourhood: noise, parties at any time of day or night, safety concerns, garbage strewn out on the street, a lack of respect for neighbours and so on, Mr. Ryan said via e-mail.Even with new regulations in place, there remain broad swaths of the country from big cities such as Calgary, to small communities in Ontarios cottage country where short-term rentals are subject to few restrictions, if any at all. As such, Prof. Wachsmuth expects Airbnb to continue growing, given that Canada is less of a mature market than the United States.Even then, he is near certain his research is still underestimating the size of the short-term rental market in Canada. But, he notes that the Canadian market has hit a turning point.Airbnb, HomeAway and other companies in the sector enjoyed a period of several years where policy-makers werent really paying attention, he said. I think that period is over now. ",

          "More than 100 years ago acoustic mirrors along the coast of England were built with the intention of using them to detect the sound of approaching German zeppelins.The concave concrete structures were designed to pick up sound waves from enemy aircraft, making it possible to predict their flight trajectory, giving enough time for ground forces to be alerted to defend the towns and cities of Britain.Image source, Joe Pettet-SmithImage caption, The sound mirror at Abbot's Cliff, between Folkestone and Dover. \"When I originally arrived at the cliff's edge, the sun was creating a harsh shadow down the face of the concave which wouldn't have done the structure any justice'\" says Pettet-Smith. \"I knew it was going to pass at some point so I just got my book out and waited.

          "NOTE: SimFix depends on several Defects4J commands. Therefore, if you want to conduct your experiment on other projects outside Defects4J, please adapt the project to the Defects4J framework. As an alternative, if you don't want to compile SimFix by youself, you also can download the replication package [HERE] directly, which will save your time for setting up the running environment. SimFix I. Introduction of SimFix II. Environment setup III. Run SimFix Step-by-Step IV. Evaluation Result V. Structure of the project I. Introduction SimFix is an automatic program repair technique, which leverages exisiting patches from other projects and similar code snippets in the same project to generate patches. The following figure is the workflow of our approach. Mining Stage Mine repair patterns from existing open-source projects, after which we can obtain a set of frequent repair patterns. Those patterns can be reused for other repairing scenarios as well. Repairing Stage Fault Localization : obtain a ranking list of candidate faulty statements and extract corresponding code snippets. Donor Snippet Identification : identify the similarity between faulty code snippet and each candidate similar code snippet by leveraging three similarity metrics, according to which we obtain a list of candidate similar snippets with decending order of similarity value. Variable Mapping : establish the mapping relationship between variables in faulty and similar code snippets by leveraging similarity metrics and then obtain a mapping table, based on which the variables in the donor code snippet will be replaced with the corresponding variables. Modification Extraction and Intersection : extract code modifications to faulty code snippet via AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) matching and differencing against the donor snippet, and then the frequent patterns from the mining stage will be used to take intersection with those modifications to further ruled out invalid ones. Patch Generation & Validation : generate repair patches by applying extracted code modifications to the faulty code snippet with combining and ranking whose modifications, then using the test suite to validate the correctness of candidate patches until a correct patch found or timeout. If you want to use this project, please cite our technical paper published at ISSTA'18. @inproceedings{Simfix:2018, author = {Jiang, Jiajun and Xiong, Yingfei and Zhang, Hongyu and Gao, Qing and Chen, Xiangqun}, title = {Shaping Program Repair Space with Existing Patches and Similar Code}, series = {ISSTA}, year = {2018}, location = {Amsterdam, Netherlands}, doi = {10.1145/3213846.3213871}, } II. Environment OS: Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS) JDK: Oracle jdk1.7 (important!) Download and configure Defects4J (branch fee5ddf020) running environment. Configure the following path. DEFECTS4J_HOME=\"home_of_defects4j\" III. How to run SimFix was traditionally developed as an Eclipse Java project, you can simply import this project to your workspace and run it as a common Java program. The main class is cofix.main.Main, and for the running option please refer to the Running Options. Before running unzip file sbfl/data.zip to sbfl/data : used for fault localization using the command line provided by Defects4J to checkout a buggy version of benchmark for testing. Example: defects4j checkout -p Chart -v 1b -w ${buggy_program_path}/chart/chart_1_buggy NOTE : the path of the buggy version of benchmark have to be set as: /projectName/projectName_id_buggy => Example: /home/user/chart/chart_1_buggy Step 1, Build The Project Originally, SimFix was developed as an Eclipse Java Project, you can simply import the project into your workspace and the class cofix.main.Main is the entry of the whole program. Step 2, Running Options Our prototype of SimFix needs three input options for running. --proj_home : the home of buggy program of benchmark. (${buggy_program_path} for the example) --proj_name : the project name of buggy program of benchmark. (chart for the example) --bug_id : the identifier of the buggy program. (1 for the example) The option of --bugy_id supports multiple formats: single_id : repair single bug, e.g., 1. startId-endId : repair a series of bugs with consecutive identifiers, e.g., 1-3. single_id,single_id,single_id : repair any bugs for the specific program, e.g., 1,5,9. all : repair all buggy versions of a specific project, i.e., all. Usage: --proj_home=${proj_home} --proj_name=${proj_name} --bug_id=${bug_id} Example: --proj_home=/home/user --proj_name=chart --bug_id=1 Another: --proj_home=/home/user --proj_name=chart --bug_id=1,4,8 OPTION 1 : Run within eclipse (please use the old version: tested on Mars, which depends on Java7). From the Main class: Run AsRun Configurations Arguments : set the above arguments as Program Arguments. OPTION 2 : run using command line. We also provide runnable jar file of SimFix in the home folder of the project i.e., simfix.jar. Set the home directory of the SimFix project as your correct path and then run as: java -jar simfix.jar --proj_home=/home/user --proj_name=chart --bug_id=1 Step 3, Result Analysis After finishing the repair, there will be two additional folders: log and patch. log : debug output, including buggy statements already tried, patches and reference code snippet for correct patch generation. patch : a single source file repaired by SimFix that can pass the test suite. In the source file, you can find the patch, which is formatted as (example of Chart_1): // start of generated patch int index=this.plot.getIndexOf(this); CategoryDataset dataset=this.plot.getDataset(index); if(dataset==null){ return result; } // end of generated patch /* start of original code int index = this.plot.getIndexOf(this); CategoryDataset dataset = this.plot.getDataset(index); if (dataset != null) { return result; } end of original code*/ IV. Evaluation Result Totally, SimFix successfully repair 34 bugs among 357 bugs in Defects4J v1.0 benchmark with generating 22 plausible but incorrect patches. The following table and venn diagram are comparison withexisting approaches. More details are presented in the sub-folder final (latest). The comparison with existing approaches. Intersections. V.

          "Credit: NASA One hundred years ago today, on May 29, 1919, measurements of a solar eclipse offered verification for Einstein's theory of general relativity. Even before that, Einstein had developed the theory of special relativity, which revolutionized the way we understand light. To this day, it provides guidance on understanding how particles move through spacea key area of research to keep spacecraft and astronauts safe from radiation. The theory of special relativity showed that particles of light, photons, travel through a vacuum at a constant pace of 670,616,629 miles per houra speed that's immensely difficult to achieve and impossible to surpass in that environment. Yet all across space, from black holes to our near-Earth environment, particles are, in fact, being accelerated to incredible speeds, some even reaching 99.9% the speed of light. One of NASA's jobs is to better understand how these particles are accelerated. Studying these superfast, or relativistic, particles can ultimately help protect missions exploring the solar system, traveling to the Moon, and they can teach us more about our galactic neighborhood: A well-aimed near-light-speed particle can trip onboard electronics and too many at once could have negative radiation effects on space-faring astronauts as they travel to the Moonor beyond. Here are three ways that acceleration happens. 1. Electromagnetic Fields Most of the processes that accelerate particles to relativistic speeds work with electromagnetic fieldsthe same force that keeps magnets on your fridge. The two components, electric and magnetic fields, like two sides of the same coin, work together to whisk particles at relativistic speeds throughout the universe. Electric and magnetic fields can add and remove energy from particles, changing their speeds. Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio In essence, electromagnetic fields accelerate charged particles because the particles feel a force in an electromagnetic field that pushes them along, similar to how gravity pulls at objects with mass. In the right conditions, electromagnetic fields can accelerate particles at near-light-speed. On Earth, electric fields are often specifically harnessed on smaller scales to speed up particles in laboratories. Particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider and Fermilab, use pulsed electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged particles up to 99.99999896% the speed of light. At these speeds, the particles can be smashed together to produce collisions with immense amounts of energy. This allows scientists to look for elementary particles and understand what the universe was like in the very first fractions of a second after the Big Bang. 2. Magnetic Explosions Magnetic fields are everywhere in space, encircling Earth and spanning the solar system. They even guide charged particles moving through space, which spiral around the fields. When these magnetic fields run into each other, they can become tangled. When the tension between the crossed lines becomes too great, the lines explosively snap and realign in a process known as magnetic reconnection. The rapid change in a region's magnetic field creates electric fields, which causes all the attendant charged particles to be flung away at high speeds. Scientists suspect magnetic reconnection is one way that particlesfor example, the solar wind, which is the constant stream of charged particles from the sunis accelerated to relativistic speeds. Those speedy particles also create a variety of side-effects near planets. Magnetic reconnection occurs close to us at points where the sun's magnetic field pushes against Earth's magnetosphereits protective magnetic environment. When magnetic reconnection occurs on the side of Earth facing away from the sun, the particles can be hurled into Earth's upper atmosphere where they spark the auroras. Magnetic reconnection is also thought to be responsible around other planets like Jupiter and Saturn, though in slightly different ways. Huge, invisible explosions are constantly occurring in the space around Earth. These explosions are the result of twisted magnetic fields that snap and realign, shooting particles across space. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft were designed and built to focus on understanding all aspects of magnetic reconnection. Using four identical spacecraft, the mission flies around Earth to catch magnetic reconnection in action. The results of the analyzed data can help scientists understand particle acceleration at relativistic speeds around Earth and across the universe. 3. Wave-Particle Interactions Particles can be accelerated by interactions with electromagnetic waves, called wave-particle interactions. When electromagnetic waves collide, their fields can become compressed. Charged particles bouncing back and forth between the waves can gain energy similar to a ball bouncing between two merging walls. These types of interactions are constantly occurring in near-Earth space and are responsible for accelerating particles to speeds that can damage electronics on spacecraft and satellites in space. NASA missions, like the Van Allen Probes, help scientists understand wave-particle interactions. Wave-particle interactions are also thought to be responsible for accelerating some cosmic rays that originate outside our solar system. After a supernova explosion, a hot, dense shell of compressed gas called a blast wave is ejected away from the stellar core. Filled with magnetic fields and charged particles, wave-particle interactions in these bubbles can launch high-energy cosmic rays at 99.6% the speed of light. Wave-particle interactions may also be partially responsible for accelerating the solar wind and cosmic rays from the sun.

          "Everyone in Silicon Valley knows the story of Xerox inventing the modern personal computer in the 1970s and then failing to commercialize it effectively. Yet one of Silicon Valley's most successful companies, Google's Alphabet, appears to be repeating Xerox's mistake with its self-driving car program. Xerox launched its Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1970. By 1975, its researchers had invented a personal computer with a graphical user interface that was almost a decade ahead of its time. Unfortunately, the commercial version of this technology wasn't released until 1981 and proved to be an expensive flop. Two much younger companiesApple and Microsoftco-opted many of Xerox's ideas and wound up dominating the industry. Google's self-driving car program, created in 2009, appears to be on a similar trajectory. By October 2015, Google was confident enough in its technology to put a blind man into one of its cars for a solo ride in Austin, Texas. But much like Xerox 40 years earlier, Google has struggled to bring its technology to market. The project was rechristened Waymo in 2016, and Waymo was supposed to launch a commercial driverless service by the end of 2018.But the service Waymo launched in December was not driverless and barely commercial. It had a safety driver in every vehicle, and it has only beenmade available to a few hundred customers. Today, a number of self-driving startups are aiming to do to Waymo what Apple did to Xerox years ago. Nuro is a driverless delivery startup that announced Monday that it raised $940 million in venture capital. Another, called Voyage, is testing a self-driving taxi service in one of the nation's largest retirement communities. Right now, these companies' self-driving services aren't as sophisticated as Waymo's. Their vehicles have top speeds of 25 miles per hour. But Apple started out making under-powered products, too, then it gradually worked its way up-market, ultimately eclipsing Xerox. If Waymo isn't strategic, companies like Nuro and Voyage could do the same thing to the pioneering self-driving company. Google foundernow Alphabet CEOLarry Page, of course,knows all about Xerox's mistakesand is determined to avoid repeating them. \"They weren't focused on commercialization,\" Page saidof Xerox in a 2013 interview with Wired. According to The Information's Amir Efrati, Page has been pushing for Waymo to commercialize since at least 2016. But Page may be drawing the wrong lesson from the Xerox experience. Xerox did try to commercialize its technology. It just didn't have a good strategy for doing so. And it's not clear that Waymo does either. Xerox squandered a massive technology lead Early computers were too expensive to be dedicated to a single user. But in the early 1970s, Xerox researchers realized that steadily falling costs would soon make personal computing economically viable. Xerox's deep pockets freed the researchers to temporarily ignore economic constraints and explore how these computers of the future might work. By 1975, PARC had produced a futuristic personal computer called the Alto. It had a bitmapped display, a mouse, and a graphical user interface. Xerox researchers developed a word processor with a what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface. Now-standard operations like \"cut,\" \"paste,\" and \"undo\" were pioneered by PARC researchers, and the Alto had powerful networking capabilities. Also in 1975, Xerox created a new Systems Development Division to commercialize PARC's computer technology.The team drew up plans for a sophisticated Office Information Systems Architecture. Every worker would have an Alto-style workstation with support for word processing, email, and other office applications. A fast network would connect the workstations to file and print servers. This vision became a reality in 1981 with the introduction of the Xerox 8010 office systemknown informally as the Star. It was a technological marvel, offering capabilities far beyond those found on other personal computers at the time. There was just one problem.The workstation started at $16,595more than $45,000 in 2019 dollars. A practical system needed several workstations as well as file and print servers, which could easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Unsurprisingly, the new system didn't sell well. Apple took a bottom-up approach Tom Munnecke/Getty Images As Xerox engineers were developing the Star, a tiny startup called Apple was building much less impressive personal computers. Apple released its first product, a $666.66 kit computer called the Apple I, in 1976.The Apple II, released the next year, came pre-assembled and sold for $1,298 ($5,300 in today's money). It was cheap enough that small companies and even individuals could think about buying one. Many computing professionals dismissed early \"microcomputers\" like the Apple II as toys, but they weren't completely useless. A key breakthrough came in 1979, whenDan Bricklin andBob Frankston released VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program, on the Apple II. VisiCalc sold hundreds of thousands of copies and helped make the Apple II an attractive choice for business customers. Also in 1979, Apple signed a pivotal deal with Xerox. It gave Xerox the right to invest $1.05 million in Apple ahead of Apple's hotly anticipated initial public offering. In exchange, Apple got an in-depth look at the technology Xerox had sequestered at PARC. In a now-famous series of meetings, PARC engineers demonstrated the Alto's advanced capabilities to a group of Apple engineers, who took copious notes. Apple's first computer with a graphical user interface, the Lisa, was released in 1983 for $9,995 ($25,000 in today's dollars). Like the Star, it was a commercial flop. But unlike Xerox, Apple quickly learned from its initial failure. Realizing that the high price was a dealbreaker for customers, Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984. Its introductory price of $2,495 ($6,000 in today's dollars) was cheap enough to make it a commercial success. ",
          "Summary: Xerox PARC created the first and best personal computer, but didn't release to the market early/often/cheaply enough to learn and dominate.

There was just one problem.The workstation started at $16,595more than $45,000 in 2019 dollars. A practical system needed several workstations as well as file and print servers, which could easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Unsurprisingly, the new system didn't sell well. Apple took a bottom-up approach Tom Munnecke/Getty Images As Xerox engineers were developing the Star, a tiny startup called Apple was building much less impressive personal computers. Apple released its first product, a $666.66 kit computer called the Apple I, in 1976.The Apple II, released the next year, came pre-assembled and sold for $1,298 ($5,300 in today's money). It was cheap enough that small companies and even individuals could think about buying one. Many computing professionals dismissed early \"microcomputers\" like the Apple II as toys, but they weren't completely useless. A key breakthrough came in 1979, whenDan Bricklin andBob Frankston released VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program, on the Apple II. VisiCalc sold hundreds of thousands of copies and helped make the Apple II an attractive choice for business customers. Also in 1979, Apple signed a pivotal deal with Xerox. It gave Xerox the right to invest $1.05 million in Apple ahead of Apple's hotly anticipated initial public offering. In exchange, Apple got an in-depth look at the technology Xerox had sequestered at PARC. In a now-famous series of meetings, PARC engineers demonstrated the Alto's advanced capabilities to a group of Apple engineers, who took copious notes. Apple's first computer with a graphical user interface, the Lisa, was released in 1983 for $9,995 ($25,000 in today's dollars). Like the Star, it was a commercial flop. But unlike Xerox, Apple quickly learned from its initial failure. Realizing that the high price was a dealbreaker for customers, Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984. Its introductory price of $2,495 ($6,000 in today's dollars) was cheap enough to make it a commercial success. ",

          "An X-ray diffraction image of part of a molecule of DNA. The new, 8-letter version, is similarly stable. Credit: Science Source/Science Photo Library The DNA of life on Earth naturally stores its information in just four key chemicals guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine, commonly referred to as G, C, A and T, respectively.Now scientists have doubled this number of lifes building blocks, creating for the first time a synthetic, eight-letter genetic language that seems to store and transcribe information just like natural DNA. In a study published on 22 February in Science1, a consortium of researchers led by Steven Benner, founder of the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Alachua, Florida, suggests that an expanded genetic alphabet could, in theory, also support life. Its a real landmark, says Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. The study implies that there is nothing particularly magic or special about those four chemicals that evolved on Earth, says Romesberg. Thats a conceptual breakthrough, he adds.Normally, as a pair of DNA strands twist around each other in a double helix, the chemicals on each strand pair up: A bonds to T, and C bonds with G.For a long time, scientists have tried to add more pairs of these chemicals, also known as bases, to this genetic code. For example, Benner first created unnatural bases in the 1980s. Other groups have followed, with Romesbergs lab making headlines in 2014 after inserting a pair of unnatural bases into a living cell.But the latest study is the first to systematically demonstrate that the complementary unnatural bases recognise and bind to each other, and that the double helix that they form holds its structure.Benners team, which includes researchers from various US companies and institutions, created the synthetic letters by tweaking the molecular structure of the regular bases. The letters of DNA pair up because they form hydrogen bonds: each contains hydrogen atoms, which are attracted to nitrogen or oxygen atoms in their partner. Benner explains that its a bit like Lego bricks that snap together when the holes and prongs line up.By adjusting these holes and prongs, the team has come up with several new pairs of bases, including a pair named S and B, and another called P and Z2. In the latest paper, they describe how they combine these four synthetic bases with the natural ones. The researchers call the resulting eight-letter language hachimoji after the Japanese words for eight and letter. The additional bases are each similar in shape to one of the natural four, but have variations in their bonding patterns.The researchers then conducted a series of experiments that showed that their synthetic sequences shares properties with natural DNA that are essential for supporting life.Data retrievalTo work as an information storage system, DNA has to follow predictable rules, so the team first demonstrated that, in a similar way to regular bases, the synthetic bases reliably formed pairs. They created hundreds of molecules of the synthetic DNA and found that the letters bound to their partners predictably.They then showed that the structure of the double helices remained stable no matter what order the synthetic bases were in. This is important because for life to evolve, DNA sequences need to be able to vary without the whole structure falling apart. Using X-ray diffraction, the team showed that three different sequences of the synthetic DNA retained the same structure when crystallised.This is a substantial advance, says Philipp Holliger, a synthetic biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, because other methods of expanding the genetic alphabet are not as structurally sound. Instead of chemicals that use hydrogen bonds to pair up, these other approaches use water-repelling molecules as their bases. These can be placed at intervals in-between the natural letters, but the structure of DNA breaks down if they are placed in a row.Finally, the team showed that the synthetic DNA could be faithfully transcribed into RNA. The ability to store information is not very interesting for evolution, says Benner. You have to be able to transfer that information into a molecule that does something.Converting DNA into RNA is a key step for translating genetic information into proteins, the workhorses of life. But some RNA sequences, known as aptamers, can themselves bind to specific molecules. Benners team created synthetic DNA that codes for a certain aptamer and then confirmed that the transcription had occurred and the RNA sequence functioned correctly.Holliger says that the work is an exciting starting point, but there is still a substantial distance to go before reaching a true eight-letter synthetic genetic system. One key question, for example, will be whether the synthetic DNA can be replicated by polymerases, the enzymes responsible for synthesizing DNA inside organisms during cell division. This has been demonstrated for other methods such as Romesbergs, which uses water-repelling bases.Variety of lifeStill, Benner says that the work shows that life could potentially be supported by DNA bases with different structures from the four that we know, which could be relevant in the search for signatures of life elsewhere in the Universe. Adding letters to DNA could also have more down-to-earth applications.With more diversity in the genetic building blocks, scientists could potentially create RNA or DNA sequences that can do things better than the standard four letters, including functions beyond genetic storage.For example, Benners group previously showed that strands of DNA that included Z and P were better at binding to cancer cells than sequences with just the standard four bases3. And Benner has set up a company which commercialises synthetic DNA for use in medical diagnostics. The researchers could potentially use their synthetic DNA to create novel proteins as well as RNA. Benners team has also developed further pairs of new bases, opening up the possibility of creating DNA structures that contain 10 or even 12 letters. But the fact that the researchers have already expanded the genetic alphabet to eight is in itself remarkable, says Romesberg. Its already doubling what nature has. ",

The 420 kg rotorcraft lander (similar in weight to an Arabian horse ) will cruise at 10m/s at a normal altitude of 500 m but may fly as high as 4 km (to study Titans planetary boundary line) during its 2.7-year primary mission. It will be powered by a 110W plutonium-fueled radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG, or more specifically the MMRTG) and carry onboard spectrometers, meteorology sensors, a gamma ray detector, a seismometer, and drills (for collecting surface samples). Waste heat from the RTG will maintain operational temperatures for batteries and electronics (except the gamma ray detector, which is mounted outside to be super-cooled by Titans -180 C atmosphere).

The MMRTG will output ~70W (2.21 GJ/year) on arrival due to fuel decay & thermocouple degradation, and with ~40% used on flight, a back-of-the-envelope max of 3.9 GB per year (0.987 kbps!) of data could be transmitted over its primary mission, far surpassing the ~100 MB that was transmitted by Huygens.

          "Ireland is ramping up its response to the climate crisis by planting forests lots of forests. East, west, north, south, the plan is to plant forests, the more the better.With enough trees, goes the hope, Ireland can compensate for many of the cows, vehicles and fossil-burning power plants that make it one of Europes worst climate offenders.From having just 1% forest cover in 1900, Ireland now has 11%, covering 770,000 hectares. It has just committed to planting 8,000 more hectares each year to reach 18% coverage.Research published last week said planting billions of trees across the world was the biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis.But some in Ireland have a problem with the great green vision. They say Ireland is planting the wrong sort of forests dark, dank abominations that kill wildlife, block sunlight and isolate communities. Its like a wall around you, dead, darkness. Its suffocating.

Last month a protester used a digger to block workers from felling trees and planting new ones.The offending species is Sitka spruce, a coniferous evergreen that dominates Irelands afforestation programme. Originally from North America, it grows quickly and tall up to 100 metres and flourishes in Irelands damp, temperate climate.About half of Irelands trees are Sitka spruces, many in packed phalanxes that blanket hills and valleys. They supply wood for pulp, plywood, pallets, fencing, garden furniture and building materials, much of it exported to Britain. And they absorb carbon, an increasingly valuable function as Ireland tries to avert fines of hundreds of millions of euros for missing targets on emissions and renewable energy.The government recently unveiled a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. With emissions from agriculture set to rise, not fall, success hinges partly on planting 8,000 hectares of new forest each year, auguring a lot more Sitka spruces.Save Leitrim activists say their county has been a laboratory for such plantations a national sacrifice zone and that the results are a warning to the rest of the country.Were not anti-trees, were anti-this, said Willie Stewart, tramping through a gloomy pine-filled grove near his home in the townland of Drumnadober.

          "Antikythera mechanismThe Antikythera mechanism (Fragment A front and rear); visible is the largest gear in the mechanism, approximately 13 centimetres (5.1in) in diameter.WritingAncient GreekPeriod/cultureHellenisticDiscovered1901Antikythera, GreecePresent locationNational Archaeological Museum, Athens The Antikythera mechanism ( AN-tih-kih-THEER-) is an ancient Greek hand-powered orrery, described as the oldest example of an analogue computer[1][2][3] used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance.[4][5][6] It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.[7][8][9] This artefact was among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901.[10][11] On 17 May 1902 it was identified as containing a gear by archaeologist Valerios Stais.[12] The device, housed in the remains of a 34cm 18cm 9cm (13.4in 7.1in 3.5in) wooden box, was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation efforts. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others.[13][14] The largest gear is approximately 13 centimetres (5.1in) in diameter and originally had 223 teeth.[15] In 2008, a team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at Cardiff University used modern computer x-ray tomography and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine. This suggests it had 37 meshing bronze gears enabling it to follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and to model the irregular orbit of the Moon, where the Moon's velocity is higher in its perigee than in its apogee. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes, and it is speculated that he may have been consulted in the machine's construction.[16] There is speculation that a portion of the mechanism is missing and it also calculated the positions of the five classical planets. The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists and has been variously dated to about 87BC,[17] or between 150 and 100BC,[4] or to 205BC,[18][19] or to within a generation before the shipwreck, which has been dated to approximately 7060BC.[20][21] Later clockwork is known from the medieval Byzantine and Islamic worlds, but works with similar complexity did not appear again until the development of mechanical astronomical clocks in Europe in the fourteenth century.[22] All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are now kept at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, along with a number of artistic reconstructions and replicas[23][24] to demonstrate how it may have looked and worked.[25] History[edit] Discovery[edit] Captain Dimitrios Kontos ( ) and a crew of sponge divers from Symi island discovered the Antikythera shipwreck during the spring of 1900, and recovered artefacts during the first expedition with the Hellenic Royal Navy, in 190001.[26] This wreck of a Roman cargo ship was found at a depth of 45 metres (148ft) off Point Glyphadia on the Greek island of Antikythera. The team retrieved numerous large artefacts, including bronze and marble statues, pottery, unique glassware, jewellery, coins, and the mechanism. The mechanism was retrieved from the wreckage in 1901, most probably in July of that year.[27] It is not known how the mechanism came to be on the cargo ship, but it has been suggested that it was being taken from Rhodes to Rome, together with other looted treasure, to support a triumphal parade being staged by Julius Caesar.[28] All of the items retrieved from the wreckage were transferred to the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens for storage and analysis. The mechanism appeared at the time to be little more than a lump of corroded bronze and wood; it went unnoticed for two years, while museum staff worked on piecing together more obvious treasures, such as the statues.[22] On 17 May 1902, archaeologist Valerios Stais found that one of the pieces of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. He initially believed that it was an astronomical clock, but most scholars considered the device to be prochronistic, too complex to have been constructed during the same period as the other pieces that had been discovered. Investigations into the object were dropped until British science historian and Yale University professor Derek J. de Solla Price became interested in it in 1951.[29] In 1971, Price and Greek nuclear physicist Charalampos Karakalos made X-ray and gamma-ray images of the 82 fragments. Price published an extensive 70-page paper on their findings in 1974.[11] Two other searches for items at the Antikythera wreck site in 2012 and 2015 have yielded a number of fascinating art objects and a second ship which may or may not be connected with the treasure ship on which the Mechanism was found.[30] Also found was a bronze disc, embellished with the image of a bull. The disc has four \"ears\" which have holes in them, and it was thought by some that it may have been part of the Antikythera Mechanism itself, as a \"cog wheel\". However, there appears to be little evidence that it was part of the Mechanism; it is more likely that the disc was a bronze decoration on a piece of furniture.[31] Origin[edit] The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known analogue computer.[32] The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it must have had undiscovered predecessors made during the Hellenistic period.[33] Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century BC[4] or the early first century BC.[34][5] In 2008, continued research by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project suggested that the concept for the mechanism may have originated in the colonies of Corinth, since they identified the calendar on the Metonic Spiral as coming from Corinth or one of its colonies in northwest Greece or Sicily.[7] Syracuse was a colony of Corinth and the home of Archimedes, and the Antikythera Mechanism Research project argued in 2008 that it might imply a connection with the school of Archimedes.[7] However, it was demonstrated in 2017 that the calendar on the Metonic Spiral is indeed of the Corinthian type but cannot be that of Syracuse.[35] Another theory suggests that coins found by Jacques Cousteau at the wreck site in the 1970s date to the time of the device's construction, and posits that its origin may have been from the ancient Greek city of Pergamon,[36] home of the Library of Pergamum. With its many scrolls of art and science, it was second in importance only to the Library of Alexandria during the Hellenistic period.[37] The ship carrying the device also contained vases in the Rhodian style, leading to a hypothesis that it was constructed at an academy founded by Stoic philosopher Posidonius on that Greek island.[38] Rhodes was a busy trading port in antiquity and a centre of astronomy and mechanical engineering, home to astronomer Hipparchus, who was active from about 140 BC to 120 BC. The mechanism uses Hipparchus' theory for the motion of the Moon, which suggests the possibility that he may have designed it or at least worked on it.[22] In addition, it has recently been argued that the astronomical events on the Parapegma of the Antikythera mechanism work best for latitudes in the range of 33.337.0 degrees north;[39] the island of Rhodes is located between the latitudes of 35.85 and 36.50 degrees north. In 2014, a study by Carman and Evans argued for a new dating of approximately 200 BC based on identifying the start-up date on the Saros Dial as the astronomical lunar month that began shortly after the new moon of 28 April 205 BC.[18][19] Moreover, according to Carman and Evans, the Babylonian arithmetic style of prediction fits much better with the device's predictive models than the traditional Greek trigonometric style.[18] A study by Paul Iversen published in 2017 reasons that the prototype for the device was indeed from Rhodes, but that this particular model was modified for a client from Epirus in northwestern Greece; Iversen argues that it was probably constructed no earlier than a generation before the shipwreck, a date supported also by Jones.[40] Further dives were undertaken in 2014, with plans to continue in 2015, in the hope of discovering more of the mechanism.[19] A five-year programme of investigations began in 2014 and ended in October 2019, with a new five-year session starting in May 2020.[41][42] Description[edit] The original mechanism apparently came out of the Mediterranean as a single encrusted piece. Soon afterward it fractured into three major pieces. Other small pieces have broken off in the interim from cleaning and handling,[43] and still others were found on the sea floor by the Cousteau expedition. Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F was discovered in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.[4][7][44] Major fragments[edit] Fragment Size [mm] Weight [g] Gears Inscriptions Notes A 180150 369.1 27 Yes The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on Fragment A. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30mm thick at its thickest point. Fragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions. B 12560 99.4 1 Yes Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the Metonic cycle. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train. C 120110 63.8 1 Yes Contains parts of the upper right of the front dial face showing calendar and zodiac inscriptions. This fragment also contains the Moon indicator dial assembly including the Moon phase sphere in its housing and a single bevel gear (ma1) used in the Moon phase indication system. D 4535 15.0 1 Contains at least one unknown gear; according to Michael T. Wright it contains possibly two, and according to Xenophon Moussas[45] it contains one gear (numbered 45 \"ME\") inside a hollow gear giving the position of Jupiter reproducing it with epicyclic motion. Their purpose and position has not been ascertained to any accuracy or consensus, but lends to the debate for the possible planet displays on the face of the mechanism. E 6035 22.1 Yes Found in 1976 and contains six inscriptions from the upper right of the Saros spiral. F 9080 86.2 Yes Found in 2005 and contains 16 inscriptions from the lower right of the Saros spiral. It also contains remnants of the mechanism's wooden housing. G 125110 31.7 Yes A combination of fragments taken from fragment C while cleaning. Minor fragments[edit] Many of the smaller fragments that have been found contain nothing of apparent value; however, a few have some inscriptions on them. Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading \"...76 years...\" which refers to the Callippic cycle. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.[15]:7 Mechanics[edit] Information on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 Nature article.[4] Operation[edit] On the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the ecliptic, the twelve zodiacal signs marked off with equal 30-degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the constellation boundaries were variable. Outside that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic Egyptian calendar, twelve months of 30 days plus five intercalary days. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the Greek alphabet. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.[5] The mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a crown gear to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.[46] The operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a \"follower\" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.[4]:10 Faces[edit] Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model Front face[edit] The front dial has two concentric circular scales. The inner scale marks the Greek signs of the Zodiac, with division in degrees. The outer scale, which is a moveable ring that sits flush with the surface and runs in a channel, is marked off with what appear to be days and has a series of corresponding holes beneath the ring in the channel. Since the discovery of the Mechanism, this outer ring has been presumed to represent the 365-day Egyptian civil calendar. However, recent research challenges this presumption and gives evidence it is most likely divided into 354 intervals.[47] If one subscribes to the 365-day presumption, it is recognized the Mechanism predates the Julian calendar reform, but the Sothic and Callippic cycles had already pointed to a 365 14-day solar year, as seen in Ptolemy III's abortive calendrical reform of 238 BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed leap day (Epag. 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter-day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years. However, if one subscribes to the 354-day evidence, then the most likely interpretation is that the ring is a manifestation of a 354-day lunar calendar. Given the era of the Mechanism's presumed construction and the presence of Egyptian month names, it is possibly the first example of the Egyptian civil-based lunar calendar proposed by Richard Anthony Parker in 1950.[48] The lunar calendars purpose was to serve as a day-to-day indicator of successive lunations, and would also have assisted with the interpretation of the Lunar phase pointer, and the Metonic and Saros dials. Undiscovered gearing, synchronous with the rest of the Metonic gearing of the mechanism, is implied to drive a pointer around this scale. Movement and registration of the ring relative to the underlying holes served to facilitate both a one-in-76-year Callippic cycle correction, as well as convenient lunisolar intercalation. The dial also marks the position of the Sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the Moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well. The following three Egyptian months are inscribed in Greek letters on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:[49] (Pachon) (Payni) (Epiphi) The other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the five days of the Egyptian intercalary month. The Zodiac dial contains Greek inscriptions of the members of the zodiac, which is believed to be adapted to the tropical month version rather than the sidereal:[15]:8[failed verification] Front panel of a 2007 recreation (Krios [Ram], Aries) (Tauros [Bull], Taurus) (Didymoi [Twins], Gemini) (Karkinos [Crab], Cancer) (Leon [Lion], Leo) (Parthenos [Maiden], Virgo) (Chelai [Scorpio's Claw or Zygos], Libra) (Skorpios [Scorpion], Scorpio) (Toxotes [Archer], Sagittarius) (Aigokeros [Goat-horned], Capricorn) (Hydrokhoos [Water carrier], Aquarius) (Ichthyes [Fish], Pisces) Also on the zodiac dial are a number of single characters at specific points (see reconstruction here:[50]). They are keyed to a parapegma, a precursor of the modern day almanac inscribed on the front face above and beneath the dials. They mark the locations of longitudes on the ecliptic for specific stars. The parapegma above the dials reads (square brackets indicate inferred text): [...] Capricorn begins to rise [...] Aries begins to rise [...] Winter solstice [...] Vernal equinox [...] ... evening [...] [...] ... evening [...] ... evening [...] The Hyades set in the evening [...] Aquarius begins to rise {} Taurus begins to rise [...] [...] {} ... evening [...] Lyra rises in the evening [...] [...] ... {evening} [...] The Pleiades rise in the morning [...] Pisces begins to rise [...] The Hyades rise in the morning [...] {} [...] Gemini begins to rise Altair rises in the evening {}{} Arcturus sets in the morning The parapegma beneath the dials reads: [...] Libra begins to rise [...] Cancer begins {to rise} [...] Autumnal equinox [...] Summer solstice [...] ... rise in the evening Orion precedes the morning [...] ... rise in the evening {} Canis Major precedes the morning [...] {} ... rise Altair sets in the morning Scorpio begins to rise [...] Leo begins to rise [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] Sagittarius begins to rise [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] At least two pointers indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the Moon, and a mean Sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The Moon position was not a simple mean Moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the Moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of epicyclic gearing. It also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88-year cycle. The mean Sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the Moon correct,[15]:20,24 then there also was likely to have been a \"true sun\" pointer in addition to the mean Sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the Sun (the orbit of Earth around the Sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.[5] Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See Proposed planet indication gearing schemes below. Mechanical engineer Michael Wright demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.[51] The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the Sun and Moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a differential gear, a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs. Rear face[edit] Computer-generated back panel In July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal Nature showing that the mechanism not only tracked the Metonic calendar and predicted solar eclipses, but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the Ancient Olympic Games.[7] Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from Epirus in northwestern Greece and with the island of Corfu, which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.[52][53][54] On the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the Metonic and the Saros, and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,[7] which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),[9] the Callippic, and the Exeligmos.[4]:11 The Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 synodic months, which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the Corinthian month names.[7][55][56] (Phoinikaios) (Kraneios) (Lanotropios) (Machaneus, \"mechanic\", referring to Zeus the inventor) (Dodekateus) (Eukleios) (Artemisios) (Psydreus) (Gameilios) (Agrianios) (Panamos) (Apellaios) Thus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so. Based on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.[56] It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.[57] The Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle. The Callippic cycle is four Metonic cycles, and so this dial indicates the current Metonic cycle in the overall Callippic cycle.[citation needed] The Games dial is the right secondary upper dial; it is the only pointer on the instrument that travels in a counter-clockwise direction as time advances. The dial is divided into four sectors, each of which is inscribed with a year indicator and the name of two Panhellenic Games: the \"crown\" games of Isthmia, Olympia, Nemea, and Pythia; and two lesser games: Naa (held at Dodona),[58] and the sixth and final set of Games recently deciphered as the Halieia of Rhodes.[59] The inscriptions on each one of the four divisions are:[4][7] Olympic dial Year of the cycle Inside the dial inscription Outside the dial inscription 1 L (Isthmia) (Olympia) 2 L (Nemea)NAA (Naa) 3 L (Isthmia) (Pythia) 4 L (Nemea) (Halieia) The Saros dial is the main lower spiral dial on the rear of the mechanism.[4]:45,10 The Saros cycle is 18 years and 11+13 days long (6585.333... days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict themnot only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:[citation needed] = (\"Selene\", Moon) = (\"Helios\", Sun) H\\M = (\"Hemeras\", of the day) \\ = (\"hora\", hour) N\\Y = (\"Nuktos\", of the night) The glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour. Solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.[15]:6 In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new full moon cycle. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.[18] The Exeligmos Dial is the secondary lower dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Exeligmos cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:[4]:10 Blank or o? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed) H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display I (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display Thus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.[citation needed] Doors[edit] The mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions.[7][15] The back door appears to be the \"instruction manual\". On one of its fragments is written \"76 years, 19 years\" representing the Callippic and Metonic cycles. Also written is \"223\" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written \"on the spiral subdivisions 235\" referring to the Metonic dial. Gearing[edit] The mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.[46] There is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted forwith the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.[5] Fragment D is a small quasi-circular constriction that, according to Xenophon Moussas, has a gear inside a somewhat larger hollow gear. The inner gear moves inside the outer gear reproducing an epicyclical motion that, with a pointer, gives the position of planet Jupiter.[60][61] The inner gear is numbered 45, \"ME\" in Greek and the same number is written on two surfaces of this small cylindrical box. The purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the celestial sphere along the ecliptic, in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the Solar System; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism. The epicyclic Solar System of Ptolemy (c. AD 100170)still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanismcarried forward with more epicycles, and was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of Copernicus (14731543), until Kepler (15711630) introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.[62] Evans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five classical planets would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.[63] Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the Sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.[5] The gear teeth were in the form of equilateral triangles with an average circular pitch of 1.6mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.[5] Due to advances in imaging and X-ray technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.[15]:8 A table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)[7] and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.[5] The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios. The gears marked with an asterisk (*) are missing, or have predecessors missing, from the known mechanism; these gears have been calculated with reasonable gear teeth counts.[7][15] The Antikythera Mechanism: known gears and accuracy of computation Gear name[table 1] Function of the gear/pointer Expected simulated interval of a full circular revolution Mechanism formula[table 2] Computed interval Gear direction[table 3] x Year gear 1 tropical year 1 (by definition) 1 year (presumed) cw[table 4] b the Moon's orbit 1 sidereal month (27.321661 days) Time(b) = Time(x) * (c1 / b2) * (d1 / c2) * (e2 / d2) * (k1 / e5) * (e6 / k2) * (b3 / e1) 27.321 days[table 5] cw r lunar phase display 1 synodic month (29.530589 days) Time(r) = 1 / (1 / Time(b2 [mean sun] or sun3 [true sun])) (1 / Time(b))) 29.530 days[table 5] n* Metonic pointer Metonic cycle () / 5 spirals around the dial = 1387.94 days Time(n) = Time(x) * (l1 / b2) * (m1 /l2) * (n1 / m2) 1387.9 days ccw[table 6] o* Games dial pointer 4 years Time(o) = Time(n) * (o1 / n2) 4.00 years cw[table 6][table 7] q* Callippic pointer 27758.8 days Time(q) = Time(n) * (p1 / n3) * (q1 /p2) 27758 days ccw[table 6] e* lunar orbit precession 8.85 years Time(e) = Time(x) * (l1 / b2) * (m1 / l2) * (e3 / m3) 8.8826 years ccw[table 8] g* Saros cycle Saros time / 4 turns = 1646.33 days Time(g) = Time(e) * (f1 / e4) * (g1 / f2) 1646.3 days ccw[table 6] i* Exeligmos pointer 19755.8 days Time(i) = Time(g) * (h1 / g2) * (i1 / h2) 19756 days ccw[table 6] The following are proposed gearing from the 2012 Freeth and Jones reconstruction: sun3* True sun pointer 1 mean year Time(sun3) = Time(x) * (sun3 / sun1) * (sun2 / sun3) 1 mean year[table 5] cw[table 9] mer2* Mercury pointer 115.88 days (synodic period) Time(mer2) = Time(x) * (mer2 / mer1) 115.89 days[table 5] cw[table 9] ven2* Venus pointer 583.93 days (synodic period) Time(ven2) = Time(x) * (ven1 / sun1) 584.39 days[table 5] cw[table 9] mars4* Mars pointer 779.96 days (synodic period) Time(mars4) = Time(x) * (mars2 / mars1) * (mars4 / mars3) 779.84 days[table 5] cw[table 9] jup4* Jupiter pointer 398.88 days (synodic period) Time(jup4) = Time(x) * (jup2 / jup1) * (jup4 / jup3) 398.88 days[table 5] cw[table 9] sat4* Saturn pointer 378.09 days (synodic period) Time(sat4) = Time(x) * (sat2 / sat1) * (sat4 / sat3) 378.06 days[table 5] cw[table 9] Table notes: ^ Change from traditional naming: X is the main year axis, turns once per year with gear B1.

There are several gear ratios for each planet that result in close matches to the correct values for synodic periods of the planets and the Sun. The ones chosen above seem to provide good accuracy with reasonable tooth counts, but the specific gears that may have been used are, and probably will remain, unknown.[5] Known gear scheme[edit] A hypothetical schematic representation of the gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, including the 2012 published interpretation of existing gearing, gearing added to complete known functions, and proposed gearing to accomplish additional functions, namely true sun pointer and pointers for the five then-known planets, as proposed by Freeth and Jones, 2012.[5] Based also upon similar drawing in the Freeth 2006 Supplement[15] and Wright 2005, Epicycles Part 2.[64] Proposed (as opposed to known from the artefact) gearing crosshatched. It is very probable that there were planetary dials, as the complicated motions and periodicities of all planets are mentioned in the manual of the mechanism. The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the Moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group). The Sun gear is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean Sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The Sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, \"true sun\" pointer that displayed the Sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.[4][7][65] The Moon train starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the Moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an epicyclic gear system; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others. Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, in consequence of Kepler's second and third laws. The modelled rotational period of the Moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the moon of 8.85 years.[4][7][65] The system also models the phases of the Moon. The Moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the Sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean Sun pointer or a hypothetical true Sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the Moon, but is also geared to the Sunthe effect is to perform a differential gear operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the Sun and Moon pointers. The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the Moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.[4][7][65] The Metonic train is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.[4][7][65] The Olympiad train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly four years, as expected. Incidentally, it is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates counter-clockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.[4][7][65] The Callippic train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.[4][7][65] The Saros train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.[4][7][65] The Exeligmos train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.[4][7][65] Apparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.[4][7][65] Reconstruction efforts[edit] Proposed gear schemes[edit] Because of the large space between the mean Sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean Sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.[5] This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward. Wright proposalEvans et al. proposalFreeth et al. proposal Michael Wright was the first person to design and build a model with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential planetarium system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the \"first anomaly\"). He included pointers for this \"true sun\", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known \"mean sun\" (current time) and lunar pointers.[5] Evans, Carman, and Thorndike published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.[63] Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.[63] Their proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.[63] In a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.[66] Freeth and Jones published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the Sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.[5] Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal The system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal: three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the Sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one; the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean Sun wheel turns.[5] The inferior planet mechanism includes the Sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.[5] For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the Sun and all the planetsexcepting only the Moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each: five gears and three slotted bars in all.[5] The superior planet systemsMars, Jupiter, and Saturnall follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.[5] Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all. In total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.[5] On the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus: ...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon. And let the Sun be golden, the Moon silver, Kronos [Saturn] of obsidian, Ares [Mars] of reddish onyx, Aphrodite [Venus] lapis lazuli veined with gold, Hermes [Mercury] turquoise; let Zeus [Jupiter] be of (whitish?) stone, crystalline (?)...[67] In March 2021, the Antikythera Research Team at University College London, led by Freeth, published their proposed reconstruction of the entire Antikythera Mechanism.[68][69][70] Accuracy[edit] Investigations by Freeth and Jones reveal that their simulated mechanism is not particularly accurate, the Mars pointer being up to 38 off at times (these inaccuracies occur at the nodal points of Mars' retrograde motion, and the error recedes at other locations in the orbit). This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather due to inadequacies in the Greek theory of planetary movements. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his Planetary Hypotheses in the second half of the second century AD (particularly adding the concept of the equant to his theory) and then finally by the introduction of Kepler's Second Law in the early 17th century.[5] In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient worldbut it didn't really work very well![5] In addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy. Freeth and Jones note that the inevitable \"looseness\" in the mechanism due to the hand-built gears, with their triangular teeth and the frictions between gears, and in bearing surfaces, probably would have swamped the finer solar and lunar correction mechanisms built into it: Though the engineering was remarkable for its era, recent research indicates that its design conception exceeded the engineering precision of its manufacture by a wide marginwith considerable cumulative inaccuracies in the gear trains, which would have cancelled out many of the subtle anomalies built into its design.[5][71] While the device itself may have struggled with inaccuracies due to the triangular teeth being hand-made, the calculations used and the technology implemented to create the elliptical paths of the planets and retrograde motion of the Moon and Mars by using a clockwork-type gear train with the addition of a pin-and-slot epicyclic mechanism predated that of the first known clocks found in antiquity in Medieval Europe by more than 1000 years.[72] Archimedes' development of the approximate value of pi and his theory of centres of gravity, along with the steps he made towards developing the calculus,[73] all suggest that the Greeks had access to more than enough mathematical knowledge beyond that of just Babylonian algebra in order to be able to model the elliptical nature of planetary motion. Of special delight to physicists, the Moon mechanism uses a special train of bronze gears, two of them linked with a slightly offset axis, to indicate the position and phase of the moon. As is known today from Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, the moon travels at different speeds as it orbits the Earth, and this speed differential is modelled by the Antikythera Mechanism, even though the ancient Greeks were not aware of the actual elliptical shape of the orbit.[74] Similar devices in ancient literature[edit] Cicero's De re publica, a first century BC philosophical dialogue, mentions two machines that some modern authors consider as some kind of planetarium or orrery, predicting the movements of the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets known at that time. They were both built by Archimedes and brought to Rome by the Roman general Marcus Claudius Marcellus after the death of Archimedes at the siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was placed in the Temple of Virtue). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to Scipio Aemilianus in the year 129 BC) saying that Gaius Sulpicius Gallus (consul with Marcellus's nephew in 166 BC, and credited by Pliny the Elder as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a \"learned explanation\" and a working demonstration of the device. I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by Thales of Miletus. That afterwards Eudoxus of Cnidus, a disciple of Plato, had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions. When Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.][75] Pappus of Alexandria stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled On Sphere-Making.[76][77] The surviving texts from ancient times describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his odometer, the exact model later used by the Romans to place their mile markers (described by Vitruvius, Heron of Alexandria and in the time of Emperor Commodus).[78] The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.[79] If Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the third century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as Lactantius (Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII), Claudian (In sphaeram Archimedes), and Proclus (Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry) in the fourth and fifth centuries. Cicero also said that another such device was built \"recently\" by his friend Posidonius, \"... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens...\"[80] It is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device. This evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and Islamic worlds, where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the Middle Ages.[81] Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the fifth or sixth century Byzantine Empire, have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.[82] In the Islamic world, Ban Ms's Kitab al-Hiyal, or Book of Ingenious Devices, was commissioned by the Caliph of Baghdad in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in monasteries. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist al-Biruni around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century astrolabe also contains a similar clockwork device.[82] It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.[22] In the 11th century, Chinese polymath Su Song constructed a mechanical clock tower that told (among other measurements) the position of some stars and planets, which where shown on a mechanically rotated armillary sphere.[83] Popular culture[edit] On 17 May 2017, Google marked the 115th anniversary of the discovery with a Google Doodle.[84][85] As of 2012, the Antikythera mechanism was displayed as part of a temporary exhibition about the Antikythera Shipwreck,[86] accompanied by reconstructions made by Ioannis Theofanidis, Derek de Solla Price, Michael Wright, the Thessaloniki University and Dionysios Kriaris. Other reconstructions are on display at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana, at the Children's Museum of Manhattan in New York, at Astronomisch-Physikalisches Kabinett in Kassel, Germany, and at the Muse des Arts et Mtiers in Paris. The National Geographic documentary series Naked Science had an episode dedicated to the Antikythera Mechanism entitled \"Star Clock BC\" that aired on 20 January 2011.[87] A documentary, The World's First Computer, was produced in 2012 by the Antikythera mechanism researcher and film-maker Tony Freeth.[88] In 2012 BBC Four aired The Two-Thousand-Year-Old Computer;[89] it was also aired on 3 April 2013 in the United States on NOVA, the PBS science series, under the name Ancient Computer.[90] It documents the discovery and 2005 investigation of the mechanism by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. A fully functioning Lego reconstruction of the Antikythera mechanism was built in 2010 by hobbyist Andy Carol, and featured in a short film produced by Small Mammal in 2011.[91] Several exhibitions have been staged worldwide,[92] leading to the main \"Antikythera shipwreck\" exhibition at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, Greece. A fictionalised version of the device was a central plot point in the film Stonehenge Apocalypse (2010), where it was used as the artefact that saved the world from impending doom.[93] The massively multiplayer video game Eve Online contains an item named \"Antikythera Element\" obtained from game content surrounding a mysterious group of non-player characters themed as ancient Greeks.[94] See also[edit] Archimedes Palimpsest Astrarium Automaton Ctesibius Reverse engineering References[edit] ^ Efstathiou, Kyriakos; Efstathiou, Marianna (1 September 2018). \"Celestial Gearbox: Oldest Known Computer is a Mechanism Designed to Calculate the Location of the Sun, Moon, and Planets\".

Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others.[13][14] The largest gear is approximately 13 centimetres (5.1in) in diameter and originally had 223 teeth.[15] In 2008, a team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at Cardiff University used modern computer x-ray tomography and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine. This suggests it had 37 meshing bronze gears enabling it to follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and to model the irregular orbit of the Moon, where the Moon's velocity is higher in its perigee than in its apogee. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes, and it is speculated that he may have been consulted in the machine's construction.[16] There is speculation that a portion of the mechanism is missing and it also calculated the positions of the five classical planets. The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists and has been variously dated to about 87BC,[17] or between 150 and 100BC,[4] or to 205BC,[18][19] or to within a generation before the shipwreck, which has been dated to approximately 7060BC.[20][21] Later clockwork is known from the medieval Byzantine and Islamic worlds, but works with similar complexity did not appear again until the development of mechanical astronomical clocks in Europe in the fourteenth century.[22] All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are now kept at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, along with a number of artistic reconstructions and replicas[23][24] to demonstrate how it may have looked and worked.[25] History[edit] Discovery[edit] Captain Dimitrios Kontos ( ) and a crew of sponge divers from Symi island discovered the Antikythera shipwreck during the spring of 1900, and recovered artefacts during the first expedition with the Hellenic Royal Navy, in 190001.[26] This wreck of a Roman cargo ship was found at a depth of 45 metres (148ft) off Point Glyphadia on the Greek island of Antikythera. The team retrieved numerous large artefacts, including bronze and marble statues, pottery, unique glassware, jewellery, coins, and the mechanism. The mechanism was retrieved from the wreckage in 1901, most probably in July of that year.[27] It is not known how the mechanism came to be on the cargo ship, but it has been suggested that it was being taken from Rhodes to Rome, together with other looted treasure, to support a triumphal parade being staged by Julius Caesar.[28] All of the items retrieved from the wreckage were transferred to the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens for storage and analysis. The mechanism appeared at the time to be little more than a lump of corroded bronze and wood; it went unnoticed for two years, while museum staff worked on piecing together more obvious treasures, such as the statues.[22] On 17 May 1902, archaeologist Valerios Stais found that one of the pieces of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. He initially believed that it was an astronomical clock, but most scholars considered the device to be prochronistic, too complex to have been constructed during the same period as the other pieces that had been discovered. Investigations into the object were dropped until British science historian and Yale University professor Derek J. de Solla Price became interested in it in 1951.[29] In 1971, Price and Greek nuclear physicist Charalampos Karakalos made X-ray and gamma-ray images of the 82 fragments. Price published an extensive 70-page paper on their findings in 1974.[11] Two other searches for items at the Antikythera wreck site in 2012 and 2015 have yielded a number of fascinating art objects and a second ship which may or may not be connected with the treasure ship on which the Mechanism was found.[30] Also found was a bronze disc, embellished with the image of a bull. The disc has four \"ears\" which have holes in them, and it was thought by some that it may have been part of the Antikythera Mechanism itself, as a \"cog wheel\". However, there appears to be little evidence that it was part of the Mechanism; it is more likely that the disc was a bronze decoration on a piece of furniture.[31] Origin[edit] The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known analogue computer.[32] The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it must have had undiscovered predecessors made during the Hellenistic period.[33] Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century BC[4] or the early first century BC.[34][5] In 2008, continued research by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project suggested that the concept for the mechanism may have originated in the colonies of Corinth, since they identified the calendar on the Metonic Spiral as coming from Corinth or one of its colonies in northwest Greece or Sicily.[7] Syracuse was a colony of Corinth and the home of Archimedes, and the Antikythera Mechanism Research project argued in 2008 that it might imply a connection with the school of Archimedes.[7] However, it was demonstrated in 2017 that the calendar on the Metonic Spiral is indeed of the Corinthian type but cannot be that of Syracuse.[35] Another theory suggests that coins found by Jacques Cousteau at the wreck site in the 1970s date to the time of the device's construction, and posits that its origin may have been from the ancient Greek city of Pergamon,[36] home of the Library of Pergamum. With its many scrolls of art and science, it was second in importance only to the Library of Alexandria during the Hellenistic period.[37] The ship carrying the device also contained vases in the Rhodian style, leading to a hypothesis that it was constructed at an academy founded by Stoic philosopher Posidonius on that Greek island.[38] Rhodes was a busy trading port in antiquity and a centre of astronomy and mechanical engineering, home to astronomer Hipparchus, who was active from about 140 BC to 120 BC. The mechanism uses Hipparchus' theory for the motion of the Moon, which suggests the possibility that he may have designed it or at least worked on it.[22] In addition, it has recently been argued that the astronomical events on the Parapegma of the Antikythera mechanism work best for latitudes in the range of 33.337.0 degrees north;[39] the island of Rhodes is located between the latitudes of 35.85 and 36.50 degrees north. In 2014, a study by Carman and Evans argued for a new dating of approximately 200 BC based on identifying the start-up date on the Saros Dial as the astronomical lunar month that began shortly after the new moon of 28 April 205 BC.[18][19] Moreover, according to Carman and Evans, the Babylonian arithmetic style of prediction fits much better with the device's predictive models than the traditional Greek trigonometric style.[18] A study by Paul Iversen published in 2017 reasons that the prototype for the device was indeed from Rhodes, but that this particular model was modified for a client from Epirus in northwestern Greece; Iversen argues that it was probably constructed no earlier than a generation before the shipwreck, a date supported also by Jones.[40] Further dives were undertaken in 2014, with plans to continue in 2015, in the hope of discovering more of the mechanism.[19] A five-year programme of investigations began in 2014 and ended in October 2019, with a new five-year session starting in May 2020.[41][42] Description[edit] The original mechanism apparently came out of the Mediterranean as a single encrusted piece. Soon afterward it fractured into three major pieces. Other small pieces have broken off in the interim from cleaning and handling,[43] and still others were found on the sea floor by the Cousteau expedition. Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F was discovered in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.[4][7][44] Major fragments[edit] Fragment Size [mm] Weight [g] Gears Inscriptions Notes A 180150 369.1 27 Yes The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on Fragment A. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30mm thick at its thickest point. Fragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions. B 12560 99.4 1 Yes Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the Metonic cycle. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train. C 120110 63.8 1 Yes Contains parts of the upper right of the front dial face showing calendar and zodiac inscriptions. This fragment also contains the Moon indicator dial assembly including the Moon phase sphere in its housing and a single bevel gear (ma1) used in the Moon phase indication system. D 4535 15.0 1 Contains at least one unknown gear; according to Michael T. Wright it contains possibly two, and according to Xenophon Moussas[45] it contains one gear (numbered 45 \"ME\") inside a hollow gear giving the position of Jupiter reproducing it with epicyclic motion. Their purpose and position has not been ascertained to any accuracy or consensus, but lends to the debate for the possible planet displays on the face of the mechanism. E 6035 22.1 Yes Found in 1976 and contains six inscriptions from the upper right of the Saros spiral. F 9080 86.2 Yes Found in 2005 and contains 16 inscriptions from the lower right of the Saros spiral. It also contains remnants of the mechanism's wooden housing. G 125110 31.7 Yes A combination of fragments taken from fragment C while cleaning. Minor fragments[edit] Many of the smaller fragments that have been found contain nothing of apparent value; however, a few have some inscriptions on them. Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading \"...76 years...\" which refers to the Callippic cycle. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.[15]:7 Mechanics[edit] Information on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 Nature article.[4] Operation[edit] On the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the ecliptic, the twelve zodiacal signs marked off with equal 30-degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the constellation boundaries were variable. Outside that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic Egyptian calendar, twelve months of 30 days plus five intercalary days. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the Greek alphabet. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.[5] The mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a crown gear to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.[46] The operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a \"follower\" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.[4]:10 Faces[edit] Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model Front face[edit] The front dial has two concentric circular scales. The inner scale marks the Greek signs of the Zodiac, with division in degrees. The outer scale, which is a moveable ring that sits flush with the surface and runs in a channel, is marked off with what appear to be days and has a series of corresponding holes beneath the ring in the channel. Since the discovery of the Mechanism, this outer ring has been presumed to represent the 365-day Egyptian civil calendar. However, recent research challenges this presumption and gives evidence it is most likely divided into 354 intervals.[47] If one subscribes to the 365-day presumption, it is recognized the Mechanism predates the Julian calendar reform, but the Sothic and Callippic cycles had already pointed to a 365 14-day solar year, as seen in Ptolemy III's abortive calendrical reform of 238 BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed leap day (Epag. 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter-day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years. However, if one subscribes to the 354-day evidence, then the most likely interpretation is that the ring is a manifestation of a 354-day lunar calendar. Given the era of the Mechanism's presumed construction and the presence of Egyptian month names, it is possibly the first example of the Egyptian civil-based lunar calendar proposed by Richard Anthony Parker in 1950.[48] The lunar calendars purpose was to serve as a day-to-day indicator of successive lunations, and would also have assisted with the interpretation of the Lunar phase pointer, and the Metonic and Saros dials. Undiscovered gearing, synchronous with the rest of the Metonic gearing of the mechanism, is implied to drive a pointer around this scale. Movement and registration of the ring relative to the underlying holes served to facilitate both a one-in-76-year Callippic cycle correction, as well as convenient lunisolar intercalation. The dial also marks the position of the Sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the Moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well. The following three Egyptian months are inscribed in Greek letters on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:[49] (Pachon) (Payni) (Epiphi) The other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the five days of the Egyptian intercalary month. The Zodiac dial contains Greek inscriptions of the members of the zodiac, which is believed to be adapted to the tropical month version rather than the sidereal:[15]:8[failed verification] Front panel of a 2007 recreation (Krios [Ram], Aries) (Tauros [Bull], Taurus) (Didymoi [Twins], Gemini) (Karkinos [Crab], Cancer) (Leon [Lion], Leo) (Parthenos [Maiden], Virgo) (Chelai [Scorpio's Claw or Zygos], Libra) (Skorpios [Scorpion], Scorpio) (Toxotes [Archer], Sagittarius) (Aigokeros [Goat-horned], Capricorn) (Hydrokhoos [Water carrier], Aquarius) (Ichthyes [Fish], Pisces) Also on the zodiac dial are a number of single characters at specific points (see reconstruction here:[50]). They are keyed to a parapegma, a precursor of the modern day almanac inscribed on the front face above and beneath the dials. They mark the locations of longitudes on the ecliptic for specific stars. The parapegma above the dials reads (square brackets indicate inferred text): [...] Capricorn begins to rise [...] Aries begins to rise [...] Winter solstice [...] Vernal equinox [...] ... evening [...] [...] ... evening [...] ... evening [...] The Hyades set in the evening [...] Aquarius begins to rise {} Taurus begins to rise [...] [...] {} ... evening [...] Lyra rises in the evening [...] [...] ... {evening} [...] The Pleiades rise in the morning [...] Pisces begins to rise [...] The Hyades rise in the morning [...] {} [...] Gemini begins to rise Altair rises in the evening {}{} Arcturus sets in the morning The parapegma beneath the dials reads: [...] Libra begins to rise [...] Cancer begins {to rise} [...] Autumnal equinox [...] Summer solstice [...] ... rise in the evening Orion precedes the morning [...] ... rise in the evening {} Canis Major precedes the morning [...] {} ... rise Altair sets in the morning Scorpio begins to rise [...] Leo begins to rise [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] Sagittarius begins to rise [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] At least two pointers indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the Moon, and a mean Sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The Moon position was not a simple mean Moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the Moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of epicyclic gearing. It also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88-year cycle. The mean Sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the Moon correct,[15]:20,24 then there also was likely to have been a \"true sun\" pointer in addition to the mean Sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the Sun (the orbit of Earth around the Sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.[5] Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See Proposed planet indication gearing schemes below. Mechanical engineer Michael Wright demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.[51] The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the Sun and Moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a differential gear, a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs. Rear face[edit] Computer-generated back panel In July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal Nature showing that the mechanism not only tracked the Metonic calendar and predicted solar eclipses, but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the Ancient Olympic Games.[7] Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from Epirus in northwestern Greece and with the island of Corfu, which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.[52][53][54] On the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the Metonic and the Saros, and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,[7] which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),[9] the Callippic, and the Exeligmos.[4]:11 The Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 synodic months, which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the Corinthian month names.[7][55][56] (Phoinikaios) (Kraneios) (Lanotropios) (Machaneus, \"mechanic\", referring to Zeus the inventor) (Dodekateus) (Eukleios) (Artemisios) (Psydreus) (Gameilios) (Agrianios) (Panamos) (Apellaios) Thus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so. Based on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.[56] It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.[57] The Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle. The Callippic cycle is four Metonic cycles, and so this dial indicates the current Metonic cycle in the overall Callippic cycle.[citation needed] The Games dial is the right secondary upper dial; it is the only pointer on the instrument that travels in a counter-clockwise direction as time advances. The dial is divided into four sectors, each of which is inscribed with a year indicator and the name of two Panhellenic Games: the \"crown\" games of Isthmia, Olympia, Nemea, and Pythia; and two lesser games: Naa (held at Dodona),[58] and the sixth and final set of Games recently deciphered as the Halieia of Rhodes.[59] The inscriptions on each one of the four divisions are:[4][7] Olympic dial Year of the cycle Inside the dial inscription Outside the dial inscription 1 L (Isthmia) (Olympia) 2 L (Nemea)NAA (Naa) 3 L (Isthmia) (Pythia) 4 L (Nemea) (Halieia) The Saros dial is the main lower spiral dial on the rear of the mechanism.[4]:45,10 The Saros cycle is 18 years and 11+13 days long (6585.333... days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict themnot only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:[citation needed] = (\"Selene\", Moon) = (\"Helios\", Sun) H\\M = (\"Hemeras\", of the day) \\ = (\"hora\", hour) N\\Y = (\"Nuktos\", of the night) The glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour. Solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.[15]:6 In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new full moon cycle. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.[18] The Exeligmos Dial is the secondary lower dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Exeligmos cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:[4]:10 Blank or o? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed) H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display I (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display Thus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.[citation needed] Doors[edit] The mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions.[7][15] The back door appears to be the \"instruction manual\". On one of its fragments is written \"76 years, 19 years\" representing the Callippic and Metonic cycles. Also written is \"223\" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written \"on the spiral subdivisions 235\" referring to the Metonic dial. Gearing[edit] The mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.[46] There is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted forwith the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.[5] Fragment D is a small quasi-circular constriction that, according to Xenophon Moussas, has a gear inside a somewhat larger hollow gear. The inner gear moves inside the outer gear reproducing an epicyclical motion that, with a pointer, gives the position of planet Jupiter.[60][61] The inner gear is numbered 45, \"ME\" in Greek and the same number is written on two surfaces of this small cylindrical box. The purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the celestial sphere along the ecliptic, in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the Solar System; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism. The epicyclic Solar System of Ptolemy (c. AD 100170)still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanismcarried forward with more epicycles, and was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of Copernicus (14731543), until Kepler (15711630) introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.[62] Evans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five classical planets would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.[63] Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the Sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.[5] The gear teeth were in the form of equilateral triangles with an average circular pitch of 1.6mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.[5] Due to advances in imaging and X-ray technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.[15]:8 A table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)[7] and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.[5] The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios. The gears marked with an asterisk (*) are missing, or have predecessors missing, from the known mechanism; these gears have been calculated with reasonable gear teeth counts.[7][15] The Antikythera Mechanism: known gears and accuracy of computation Gear name[table 1] Function of the gear/pointer Expected simulated interval of a full circular revolution Mechanism formula[table 2] Computed interval Gear direction[table 3] x Year gear 1 tropical year 1 (by definition) 1 year (presumed) cw[table 4] b the Moon's orbit 1 sidereal month (27.321661 days) Time(b) = Time(x) * (c1 / b2) * (d1 / c2) * (e2 / d2) * (k1 / e5) * (e6 / k2) * (b3 / e1) 27.321 days[table 5] cw r lunar phase display 1 synodic month (29.530589 days) Time(r) = 1 / (1 / Time(b2 [mean sun] or sun3 [true sun])) (1 / Time(b))) 29.530 days[table 5] n* Metonic pointer Metonic cycle () / 5 spirals around the dial = 1387.94 days Time(n) = Time(x) * (l1 / b2) * (m1 /l2) * (n1 / m2) 1387.9 days ccw[table 6] o* Games dial pointer 4 years Time(o) = Time(n) * (o1 / n2) 4.00 years cw[table 6][table 7] q* Callippic pointer 27758.8 days Time(q) = Time(n) * (p1 / n3) * (q1 /p2) 27758 days ccw[table 6] e* lunar orbit precession 8.85 years Time(e) = Time(x) * (l1 / b2) * (m1 / l2) * (e3 / m3) 8.8826 years ccw[table 8] g* Saros cycle Saros time / 4 turns = 1646.33 days Time(g) = Time(e) * (f1 / e4) * (g1 / f2) 1646.3 days ccw[table 6] i* Exeligmos pointer 19755.8 days Time(i) = Time(g) * (h1 / g2) * (i1 / h2) 19756 days ccw[table 6] The following are proposed gearing from the 2012 Freeth and Jones reconstruction: sun3* True sun pointer 1 mean year Time(sun3) = Time(x) * (sun3 / sun1) * (sun2 / sun3) 1 mean year[table 5] cw[table 9] mer2* Mercury pointer 115.88 days (synodic period) Time(mer2) = Time(x) * (mer2 / mer1) 115.89 days[table 5] cw[table 9] ven2* Venus pointer 583.93 days (synodic period) Time(ven2) = Time(x) * (ven1 / sun1) 584.39 days[table 5] cw[table 9] mars4* Mars pointer 779.96 days (synodic period) Time(mars4) = Time(x) * (mars2 / mars1) * (mars4 / mars3) 779.84 days[table 5] cw[table 9] jup4* Jupiter pointer 398.88 days (synodic period) Time(jup4) = Time(x) * (jup2 / jup1) * (jup4 / jup3) 398.88 days[table 5] cw[table 9] sat4* Saturn pointer 378.09 days (synodic period) Time(sat4) = Time(x) * (sat2 / sat1) * (sat4 / sat3) 378.06 days[table 5] cw[table 9] Table notes: ^ Change from traditional naming: X is the main year axis, turns once per year with gear B1.

There are several gear ratios for each planet that result in close matches to the correct values for synodic periods of the planets and the Sun. The ones chosen above seem to provide good accuracy with reasonable tooth counts, but the specific gears that may have been used are, and probably will remain, unknown.[5] Known gear scheme[edit] A hypothetical schematic representation of the gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, including the 2012 published interpretation of existing gearing, gearing added to complete known functions, and proposed gearing to accomplish additional functions, namely true sun pointer and pointers for the five then-known planets, as proposed by Freeth and Jones, 2012.[5] Based also upon similar drawing in the Freeth 2006 Supplement[15] and Wright 2005, Epicycles Part 2.[64] Proposed (as opposed to known from the artefact) gearing crosshatched. It is very probable that there were planetary dials, as the complicated motions and periodicities of all planets are mentioned in the manual of the mechanism. The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the Moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group). The Sun gear is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean Sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The Sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, \"true sun\" pointer that displayed the Sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.[4][7][65] The Moon train starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the Moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an epicyclic gear system; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others. Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, in consequence of Kepler's second and third laws. The modelled rotational period of the Moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the moon of 8.85 years.[4][7][65] The system also models the phases of the Moon. The Moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the Sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean Sun pointer or a hypothetical true Sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the Moon, but is also geared to the Sunthe effect is to perform a differential gear operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the Sun and Moon pointers. The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the Moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.[4][7][65] The Metonic train is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.[4][7][65] The Olympiad train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly four years, as expected. Incidentally, it is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates counter-clockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.[4][7][65] The Callippic train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.[4][7][65] The Saros train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.[4][7][65] The Exeligmos train is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.[4][7][65] Apparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.[4][7][65] Reconstruction efforts[edit] Proposed gear schemes[edit] Because of the large space between the mean Sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean Sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.[5] This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward. Wright proposalEvans et al. proposalFreeth et al. proposal Michael Wright was the first person to design and build a model with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential planetarium system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the \"first anomaly\"). He included pointers for this \"true sun\", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known \"mean sun\" (current time) and lunar pointers.[5] Evans, Carman, and Thorndike published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.[63] Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.[63] Their proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.[63] In a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.[66] Freeth and Jones published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the Sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.[5] Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal The system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal: three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the Sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one; the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean Sun wheel turns.[5] The inferior planet mechanism includes the Sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.[5] For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the Sun and all the planetsexcepting only the Moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each: five gears and three slotted bars in all.[5] The superior planet systemsMars, Jupiter, and Saturnall follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.[5] Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all. In total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.[5] On the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus: ...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon. And let the Sun be golden, the Moon silver, Kronos [Saturn] of obsidian, Ares [Mars] of reddish onyx, Aphrodite [Venus] lapis lazuli veined with gold, Hermes [Mercury] turquoise; let Zeus [Jupiter] be of (whitish?) stone, crystalline (?)...[67] In March 2021, the Antikythera Research Team at University College London, led by Freeth, published their proposed reconstruction of the entire Antikythera Mechanism.[68][69][70] Accuracy[edit] Investigations by Freeth and Jones reveal that their simulated mechanism is not particularly accurate, the Mars pointer being up to 38 off at times (these inaccuracies occur at the nodal points of Mars' retrograde motion, and the error recedes at other locations in the orbit). This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather due to inadequacies in the Greek theory of planetary movements. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his Planetary Hypotheses in the second half of the second century AD (particularly adding the concept of the equant to his theory) and then finally by the introduction of Kepler's Second Law in the early 17th century.[5] In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient worldbut it didn't really work very well![5] In addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy. Freeth and Jones note that the inevitable \"looseness\" in the mechanism due to the hand-built gears, with their triangular teeth and the frictions between gears, and in bearing surfaces, probably would have swamped the finer solar and lunar correction mechanisms built into it: Though the engineering was remarkable for its era, recent research indicates that its design conception exceeded the engineering precision of its manufacture by a wide marginwith considerable cumulative inaccuracies in the gear trains, which would have cancelled out many of the subtle anomalies built into its design.[5][71] While the device itself may have struggled with inaccuracies due to the triangular teeth being hand-made, the calculations used and the technology implemented to create the elliptical paths of the planets and retrograde motion of the Moon and Mars by using a clockwork-type gear train with the addition of a pin-and-slot epicyclic mechanism predated that of the first known clocks found in antiquity in Medieval Europe by more than 1000 years.[72] Archimedes' development of the approximate value of pi and his theory of centres of gravity, along with the steps he made towards developing the calculus,[73] all suggest that the Greeks had access to more than enough mathematical knowledge beyond that of just Babylonian algebra in order to be able to model the elliptical nature of planetary motion. Of special delight to physicists, the Moon mechanism uses a special train of bronze gears, two of them linked with a slightly offset axis, to indicate the position and phase of the moon. As is known today from Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, the moon travels at different speeds as it orbits the Earth, and this speed differential is modelled by the Antikythera Mechanism, even though the ancient Greeks were not aware of the actual elliptical shape of the orbit.[74] Similar devices in ancient literature[edit] Cicero's De re publica, a first century BC philosophical dialogue, mentions two machines that some modern authors consider as some kind of planetarium or orrery, predicting the movements of the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets known at that time. They were both built by Archimedes and brought to Rome by the Roman general Marcus Claudius Marcellus after the death of Archimedes at the siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was placed in the Temple of Virtue). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to Scipio Aemilianus in the year 129 BC) saying that Gaius Sulpicius Gallus (consul with Marcellus's nephew in 166 BC, and credited by Pliny the Elder as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a \"learned explanation\" and a working demonstration of the device. I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by Thales of Miletus. That afterwards Eudoxus of Cnidus, a disciple of Plato, had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions. When Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.][75] Pappus of Alexandria stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled On Sphere-Making.[76][77] The surviving texts from ancient times describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his odometer, the exact model later used by the Romans to place their mile markers (described by Vitruvius, Heron of Alexandria and in the time of Emperor Commodus).[78] The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.[79] If Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the third century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as Lactantius (Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII), Claudian (In sphaeram Archimedes), and Proclus (Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry) in the fourth and fifth centuries. Cicero also said that another such device was built \"recently\" by his friend Posidonius, \"... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens...\"[80] It is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device. This evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and Islamic worlds, where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the Middle Ages.[81] Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the fifth or sixth century Byzantine Empire, have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.[82] In the Islamic world, Ban Ms's Kitab al-Hiyal, or Book of Ingenious Devices, was commissioned by the Caliph of Baghdad in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in monasteries. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist al-Biruni around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century astrolabe also contains a similar clockwork device.[82] It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.[22] In the 11th century, Chinese polymath Su Song constructed a mechanical clock tower that told (among other measurements) the position of some stars and planets, which where shown on a mechanically rotated armillary sphere.[83] Popular culture[edit] On 17 May 2017, Google marked the 115th anniversary of the discovery with a Google Doodle.[84][85] As of 2012, the Antikythera mechanism was displayed as part of a temporary exhibition about the Antikythera Shipwreck,[86] accompanied by reconstructions made by Ioannis Theofanidis, Derek de Solla Price, Michael Wright, the Thessaloniki University and Dionysios Kriaris. Other reconstructions are on display at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana, at the Children's Museum of Manhattan in New York, at Astronomisch-Physikalisches Kabinett in Kassel, Germany, and at the Muse des Arts et Mtiers in Paris. The National Geographic documentary series Naked Science had an episode dedicated to the Antikythera Mechanism entitled \"Star Clock BC\" that aired on 20 January 2011.[87] A documentary, The World's First Computer, was produced in 2012 by the Antikythera mechanism researcher and film-maker Tony Freeth.[88] In 2012 BBC Four aired The Two-Thousand-Year-Old Computer;[89] it was also aired on 3 April 2013 in the United States on NOVA, the PBS science series, under the name Ancient Computer.[90] It documents the discovery and 2005 investigation of the mechanism by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. A fully functioning Lego reconstruction of the Antikythera mechanism was built in 2010 by hobbyist Andy Carol, and featured in a short film produced by Small Mammal in 2011.[91] Several exhibitions have been staged worldwide,[92] leading to the main \"Antikythera shipwreck\" exhibition at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, Greece. A fictionalised version of the device was a central plot point in the film Stonehenge Apocalypse (2010), where it was used as the artefact that saved the world from impending doom.[93] The massively multiplayer video game Eve Online contains an item named \"Antikythera Element\" obtained from game content surrounding a mysterious group of non-player characters themed as ancient Greeks.[94] See also[edit] Archimedes Palimpsest Astrarium Automaton Ctesibius Reverse engineering References[edit] ^ Efstathiou, Kyriakos; Efstathiou, Marianna (1 September 2018). \"Celestial Gearbox: Oldest Known Computer is a Mechanism Designed to Calculate the Location of the Sun, Moon, and Planets\".

          "Until Lockheed Martin finally builds the SR-72 Mach-6 spy plane it announced in November 2013 and which reportedly appeared in plain view for the first time in July 2017 the iconic SR-71 Blackbird, capable of flying three times the speed of sound, remains the fastest warplane ever flown operationally. So fast that no missiles fired at it had a chance of hitting. When the U-2 spy plane was built in the 1950s, its designer Clarence Kelly Johnson already knew that it would be vulnerable to enemy defenses. So to gather intelligence in foreign skies, in 1964 U.S. president Lyndon Johnson announced that the Lockheed Advance Development Projects, also known as the Skunk Works, would build another strategic reconnaissance aircraftone so fast that no other airplane could reach it. The Blackbirds flight characteristics were incredible. It was able to fly at more than three and a half times the speed of sound at 88,000 feet. To give you an idea of what that altitude means, the SR-71 took photos from three times the height of Mount Everest and its pilots dressed in full pressure suits like astronauts. During its more than three-decade career, which ended on Oct. 9, 1999, no SR-71 was lost to hostile action. But not for a lack of trying on the part of Americas enemies. Neither enemy fighters nor surface-to-air missiles were ever able to shoot down or damage an SR-71. High speed was one factor. But the Blackbird was also hard to detected by radar, being the first aircraft to feature stealth technology. A special paint was used on the SR-71s wings, tail and fuselage. Containing iron ferrite, this paint absorbed radar energy instead of returning it to the sender. With a Radar Cross Section equivalent to a small light aircraft, the SR-71 appeared on enemy radar screens too late for a missile computer to estimate its direction for a successful shoot-down. The Blackbird also masked its range and bearing by jamming enemy listening devices with sophisticated electronic countermeasures. Not only were SAMs unable to catch the Blackbird, even the the fastest Soviet fighter jets lacked the necessary speed to intercept the SR-71. Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko, who defected to Japan in a MiG-25 on Dec. 6, 1976, confirmed this in his book MiG Pilot. American reconnaissance planes, SR-71s, were prowling off the coast, staying outside Soviet airspace by photographing terrain hundreds of miles inland with side-angle cameras, Belenko wrote. They taunted and toyed with the MiG-25s sent up to intercept them, scooting up to altitudes the Soviet planes could not reach, and circling leisurely above them or dashing off at speeds the Russians could not match. Continued Belenko: [The Soviets] had a master plan to intercept an SR-71 by positioning a MiG-25 in front of it and one below it, and when the SR-71 passed they would fire missiles. But it never occurred. Soviet computers were very primitive, and there is no way that mission can be accomplished. First of all, the SR-71 flies too high and too fast. The MiG-25 cannot reach it or catch it. Secondly the missiles are useless above 27,000 meters [88,000 feet], and as you know, the SR-71 cruises much higher. But even if we could reach it, our missiles lack the velocity to overtake the SR-71 if they are fired in a tail chase. And if they are fired head-on, the guidance systems cannot adjust quickly enough to the high closing speed. Moreover, Belenkos missiles would have not worked because most air- to-air missiles are optimized to maneuver in the thicker air below around 30,000 feet in order to shoot down an enemy plane, former Blackbird pilot Col. Richard Graham explained in his book SR-71: The Complete Illustrated History of the Blackbird. Firing at the SR-71, cruising at 75,000 feet, the air is so thin that any maneuvering capability of the missile is practically nonexistent. With the Mach-6 SR-72 a real possibility, speed is the new stealth is Lockheed Martins new slogan. But really, theres nothing new about it. Speed has worked to protect spy planes for the last 60 years. This article by Dario Leone and David Cenciotti originally appeared at War is Boring in 2017. Image: Wikimedia ",
          "Is there any single piece of technology that's more retro-futuristic than the SR-71? It is undefinably iconic especially if you understand what happened behind the scenes.

And then they had to build the machines to work that alloy: new machines - tape-based robots - to precisely carve it into shape, new procedures to put it together, and new philosophies to let it fly. These planes were designed to fly so fast that ordinary Titanium-based alloys would melt or weaken over time leading to rapid, unplanned disassembly. They didn’t have more advanced ceramics which could do the job, so Kelly Johnson’s team came up with a new alloy that was annealed - or re-tempered - in flight, so that it became stronger and stronger over time.

          "https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523265/facebook-events-groups-redesign-news-feed-features-f8-2019",
          "Facebook announced an overhaul of its main mobile app today that puts more emphasis on two of its most critical features: events and groups. The company says its placing groups front and center as a cornerstone of how it wants users to think of the main Facebook app, while events is getting a fresh coat of paint as one of the most-used parts of the app that keeps users coming back day in and day out. There are tens of millions of active groups on Facebook. When people find the right one, it often becomes the most meaningful part of how they use Facebook. And today, more than 400 million people on Facebook belong to a group that they find meaningful, the company said in a blog post. With this in mind, were rolling out a fresh new design for Facebook thats simpler and puts your communities at the center. Were also introducing new tools that will help make it easier for you to discover and engage with groups of people who share your interests. Facebook says the mobile redesign will start rolling out immediately on iOS and Android around the world. Its also working on a desktop redesign that will arrive in the coming months. The biggest change to note is the new groups tab thats now placed in the middle row of the redesigned menu bar. When tapping in, users will now get a personalized feed of updates from their various groups as well as recommendations to join new groups based on their interests. Image: Facebook Image: Facebook Image: Facebook Theres also a new feature, called Meet New Friends, that Facebook is seeding throughout the entire app to help people connect with strangers that have shared interests or real-world connections, like working for the same employer or attending the same school. Facebook says it is integrating Meet New Friends into its new groups design to help people meet who may have a shared online interest and a real-world connection that means they can connect in the real world. Facebook is making a concerted effort to ensure groups are visible in every part of the app, so itll start promoting groups in areas like Marketplace and Watch. Its also building specific tools tailored to group types, like a new listing format for groups focused on finding new jobs or buying buttons built into live broadcasts for groups that focus on selling used products. With the new design, the company says youll also be able to post to any group youre a part of from the News Feed as if you were posting to your own profile. As for events, Facebook is putting a big emphasis on helping you find stuff to do in your neighborhood. The new events tab, which now sits next to the groups tab in the new menu bar layout, has a richer map view for seeing where the events youre interested in are in proximity to one another. Theres also a much more intuitive look and feel to the design that makes it easy to find new events, organize your calendar, and quickly sift through events your friends are hosting and public ones, like concerts, that you may be interested in checking out. Facebook is in the earliest stages of completely redefining the type of company it wants to be and the products it wants to offer, following CEO Mark Zuckerbergs pledge last month to transition the social network into a privacy-focused communications platform. Part of that process involves knitting together its three massive messaging and photo-sharing apps into one unified service, despite the obvious complications there. The other part of that process will involve establishing why people will want to use the main Facebook app in the future, and how the company can better serve those people as it transitions away from the News Feed. The public feed, which encouraged sharing and tried to incentivize people to connect and engage with as many people as possible, became a core pillar of Facebook that has defined its last decade of operation. Yet the News Feed and its primary utility as a data-harvesting tool to help Facebook serve ads targeted toward your online behavior also remains the biggest source of the companys ongoing problems around data privacy, security, moderation, and platform misuse. The News Feed treated every user as a publisher on the worlds biggest media platform, but Facebook largely ignored or tried to absolve itself of responsibility for the effects that would have on society when it grew to include one-third of the Earths population. In the process, Facebook became a tool for violence and authoritarianism in developing countries, an anchor thats helped tank the news industry, and a megaphone for extremists who are looking to broadcast and amplify acts of terror. One of the primary architects of the News Feed, Chris Cox, left the company last month after Zuckerberg announced his new philosophy and planned direction for the company, helping signal that the News Feed era is officially over. The News Feed is far from going away, and Facebook has a lot of work to do to remedy its toxic effects on online discourse, election integrity, and misinformation and fake news. But Zuckerberg has made clear as did the exodus of users that flocked to Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch, and other social platforms that the News Feed is an antiquated way of thinking about and trying to foster online communication and interaction. With these changes to events and groups, Facebook is staking out a new vision of its core app thats less dictated by the algorithmic whims of the News Feed and the companys prior growth-at-all-costs philosophy. (Facebook continues to grow nonetheless: it hit close to 2.4 billion monthly active users as of last week.) The main utility people get from Facebook these days is in connecting with communities both large and small that are largely away from the public eye and centered on a shared interest. Facebook is also great at just being an address book, an events calendar, and for at least a subset of aging social media users a way to reconnect with old high school and college friends. For that to work, the company is taking its cues from sites it once considered threats, like Reddit and other community-based social networks, before it grew big enough to eclipse the most populous countries on Earth. As a result, it appears Zuckerberg sees less of a reason to invest in the old, outdated vision of a global town square that treats connection and the power to broadcast to the world as a de facto benefit for humanity.

        "url_text": "Facebook announced an overhaul of its main mobile app today that puts more emphasis on two of its most critical features: events and groups. The company says its placing groups front and center as a cornerstone of how it wants users to think of the main Facebook app, while events is getting a fresh coat of paint as one of the most-used parts of the app that keeps users coming back day in and day out. There are tens of millions of active groups on Facebook. When people find the right one, it often becomes the most meaningful part of how they use Facebook. And today, more than 400 million people on Facebook belong to a group that they find meaningful, the company said in a blog post. With this in mind, were rolling out a fresh new design for Facebook thats simpler and puts your communities at the center. Were also introducing new tools that will help make it easier for you to discover and engage with groups of people who share your interests. Facebook says the mobile redesign will start rolling out immediately on iOS and Android around the world. Its also working on a desktop redesign that will arrive in the coming months. The biggest change to note is the new groups tab thats now placed in the middle row of the redesigned menu bar. When tapping in, users will now get a personalized feed of updates from their various groups as well as recommendations to join new groups based on their interests. Image: Facebook Image: Facebook Image: Facebook Theres also a new feature, called Meet New Friends, that Facebook is seeding throughout the entire app to help people connect with strangers that have shared interests or real-world connections, like working for the same employer or attending the same school. Facebook says it is integrating Meet New Friends into its new groups design to help people meet who may have a shared online interest and a real-world connection that means they can connect in the real world. Facebook is making a concerted effort to ensure groups are visible in every part of the app, so itll start promoting groups in areas like Marketplace and Watch. Its also building specific tools tailored to group types, like a new listing format for groups focused on finding new jobs or buying buttons built into live broadcasts for groups that focus on selling used products. With the new design, the company says youll also be able to post to any group youre a part of from the News Feed as if you were posting to your own profile. As for events, Facebook is putting a big emphasis on helping you find stuff to do in your neighborhood. The new events tab, which now sits next to the groups tab in the new menu bar layout, has a richer map view for seeing where the events youre interested in are in proximity to one another. Theres also a much more intuitive look and feel to the design that makes it easy to find new events, organize your calendar, and quickly sift through events your friends are hosting and public ones, like concerts, that you may be interested in checking out. Facebook is in the earliest stages of completely redefining the type of company it wants to be and the products it wants to offer, following CEO Mark Zuckerbergs pledge last month to transition the social network into a privacy-focused communications platform. Part of that process involves knitting together its three massive messaging and photo-sharing apps into one unified service, despite the obvious complications there. The other part of that process will involve establishing why people will want to use the main Facebook app in the future, and how the company can better serve those people as it transitions away from the News Feed.

          "https://orbitalindex.com/archive/2019-07-30-Issue-23/",
          "So, you want to build a CubeSat? First, select an appropriate CubeSat form factor based on payload size, power requirements, and deployment mechanism. Consider power budget (especially for when the spacecraft is in eclipse on the dark side of the Earth), acceleration and vibration tolerance (the sound of launch alone can damage the spacecraft), and thermal management (your satellite is effectively sitting in a rather large vacuum thermos). Use Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts with existing flight heritage wherever possiblesee satsearch and CubeSatShop. Pick solar panels, batteries, and an Electrical Power System (EPS) to manage them. Include one or more antennas and radios to talk to a ground station or ground station network (or broadcast up to GlobalStar or Iridium instead). If you need to maintain orientation, include an Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) which will use some combination of Earth, Sun, and star trackers, gyroscopes, GPS receivers, and magnetometers to sense orientation, and rotate the spacecraft using magnetorquers and reaction wheels. Some CubeSats are even starting to have miniature thrusters for attitude control, desaturation, and orbit maintenance. Deployable components, such as antennas and solar panels, are usually stored under tension and released with electromagnets or redundant burn wires. Next, select an On-Board Computer (OBC) for Command & Data Handling (C&DH) and the software that will run on it, such as the open-source KubOS (made by a startup Andrew works for). Prior to assembly, perform flatsat testing with everything wired on a bench. This is also when you should test communicating with the spacecraft via its radios. Once assembled, put the CubeSat through vibration and thermal vacuum testing to ensure that it will survive the stresses of launch and the space environment. Finally, obtain the required certifications for earth observation, radio licenses, and an approved deorbit plan. NASA has a helpful guide for first time CubeSat developers with instructions and templates, and also a state of the art technology report. As always, see Awesome Space for more resources. (This overview is incompleteplease do not base your spacecraft design on an email newsletter.)The Starhopper has hopped. Last week, SpaceXs squat test version of its Starship spacecraft successfully made its first untethered hop, reaching 20 m and translating sideways. The videos are impressive (engine cam, drone cam, composite for different/better views), partly just for the immense amount of fire, dust, and exhaust producedits difficult to imagine the scale of 35 Raptor engines doing this on the proposed Super Heavy booster. The hop happened after several delays, one when a test Raptor had its oxygen turbine stator liberated and purportedly damaged the engine mounted next to it. Just two days before the successful hop, an attempt was aborted immediately after ignition due to high chamber pressure (too much thrust is not a problem new rockets usually have). With the hop, Raptor became the first full-flow staged combustion engine to fly. Throughout testing, SpaceX has continued to refine the Raptor engine, fixing 600 Hz oscillation issues and increasing chamber pressure (now a record ~275 bar). The level of transparency compared to other rocket development programs is phenomenal and its entertaining that the majority of Starship/Super Heavy/Starhopper information has been disseminated via Twitter. Recent tweets suggest a hop to 200 m could happen within a week or two.An explanation for Supermassive Black Holes. Most big galaxies (including ours) contain a Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at their center that anchors and shapes the host galaxy. SMBHs are black holes with masses of 100s of millions to billions of Suns, and their formation is difficult to explain. Normal black holes (with masses > ~2 Suns) form when stars overcome degeneracy pressure and collapse into gravitational singularities. (Black holes are especially cool because their formation is dictated by quantum mechanics.) Given time, a normal black hole can absorb enough matter to become an SMBH, but this mechanism cant explain SMBHs that formed shortly after the Big Bang, such as 83 SMBHs identified in a recent study, or an 800 million Sun SMBH that formed just an estimated 690 million years after the Big Bang. Now, a new study (paper) attempts to explain early SMBHs mathematically through a process of direct collapse with no stars involved in which early-Universe matter collapsed very quickly over very short periods of time.

          "It's round. Case closed. Every fringe theorist needs an amplifierused to be the penny press; today it's the Web. For posterity's sake, here's Ars' recent look at reality vs. belief about the shape of the Earth. Click for a full transcript. Until the 17th century, the Fensa broad, flat swath of marshland in eastern Englandwere home only to game-hunters and fishermen. Eventually, though, their value as potential agricultural land became too enticing to ignore, and the Earl of Bedford, along with a number of gentlemen adventurers, signed contracts with Charles I to drain the area, beginning in the 1630s. A series of drainage channels were cut, criss-crossing the wetlands of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. The plan was a qualified success; a vast area was now farmable, though wind-powered pumps were needed to keep the water at bay. The most notable feature of the Fens is their pancake-like topography. Its said that if you climb the tower of Ely Cathedral on a clear day, you can make out the silhouette of Peterborough Cathedral, some 30 miles to the northwest. Indeed, one could see even further if it wasnt for the curvature of the Earth. Enter one Samuel Birley Rowbotham, a 19th-century inventor and quack doctor who went by the name Parallax. Rowbotham believed that the Earth was flat, and that the Fens were the perfect place to prove it. In particular, he set his sights on the Old Bedford River, one of the 17th-century drainage cuts built under the tenure of the Earl of Bedford. The riverits really a canalruns straight as an arrow for some 22 miles, from Earith, Cambridgeshire, to Downham Market, Norfolk, where it meets the River Great Ouse. If the world were actually round, Rowbotham argued, its curvature should be plain enough to keen-eyed observers who positioned themselves along the length of the canal. In his view, the Earth was actually disk-shaped, with the north pole at its center. The sun, he reasoned, was about 400 miles from London; the stars were no more than 1,000 miles away. (Nor did he believe the Universe was as old as scientists were saying; he was also a young-Earth creationist.) Its one thing to believe the world is flat; it is yet another to convince the scientific establishment. One of Rowbothams followers, a man named John Hampden, sought out a reputable scientist that he could drag into the debate. Oddly, that man ended up being Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of natural selection. In 1870, Hampden wrote to Wallace proposing a 500 wager on the shape of the Earth (roughly 60,000 in todays money). The plan was to carefully measure the curvature of the waters surface on the Fensassuming there is anyand settle the matter once and for all. Wallace, much to the chagrin of his fellow scientists, accepted the wager. Wallace and Hampden met in early March, 1870, at Downham Market, at the northern end of the Old Bedford River, ready to perform the great experiment. A team of assistants erected six-foot-tall poles, with colored markers at the top, at one-mile intervals along a six-mile stretch of the canal, between Downham and the small town of Welney. If the Earth really was curved, the middle markers ought to be raised relative to the end markers by several feet; as Wallace wrote, with a good telescope curvature will be easily seen if it exists. Notable modern public proponents of flat Earth falsities include a man who built his own rocketship... Mike Hughes / YouTube ...and [checks the text once more] NBA superstar Kyrie Irving? Huh?

There were other hints that, whatever shape the Earth might be, it couldnt be flat: As a sailing ship sails over the horizon, its hull disappears from view first; then its sails, and the top of its mast last of all. None of this was as compelling as the testimony of those who sailed all the way around; in 1522, Ferdinand Magellans crew pulled it off (though Magellan himself didnt make it; he was killed during a battle in the Philippines). Just two decades later, in 1543, Copernicus published his groundbreaking work On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, arguing that the Earth was just like the other planets; viewed from the right perspective, our whole world was just a little ball floating in space. When Yuri Gagarin orbited the planet in his Vostok spacecraft in 1961, no one was surprised that his voyage took him in a circle. Five and a half years later, the astronauts on board Apollo 8 travelled so far from Earth that our home planet was reduced to a marble suspended in the blackness of space, famously captured in Bill Anders Earthrise photograph. His fellow astronaut Jim Lovell remarked that, from the distance of the Moon, he had no trouble hiding the Earth behind an outstretched thumb. The case, in other words, has been closed for some time. And yet, a survey conducted last spring found that a solid 16 percent of Americans arent sure of the Earths shapewith flat-Earth support running highest among millennials and those with lower incomes. The doubters have a smattering of celebrities and self-promoters on their side, from rapper B.o.B. and NBA basketball star Kyrie Irving to amateur rocketeer Mike Hughes, who last year launched himself about 1,875 feet into the air in a homemade rocket and parachuted back to Earth. The modern flat Earth movement is a peculiar mix of seemingly-harmless fun and, perhaps, something darker. Presumably, some flat Earthers are just in it for the clicks and likes; as writer Thomas Beller suggested recently in the New Yorker, its possible that flat-Earth-ism is, for some, a bit of droll performance art. But Michael Marshall, who attended a recent flat Earth conference in Birmingham, UK, found that the majority of attendees were sincere. Writing in the Guardian, Marshall described the event as a raucous departure from scientific norms where people are free to believe literally anything. The notion of an egg-shaped Universe was put forward, as was a rather creative Pac Man theory of the Universe, in which those who disappear off to one side of space might reappear from the other. And yet, to describe flat Earthers as anti-science is an oversimplification. One gets the impression that theyre not against science as such; its just that theyre deeply skeptical of mainstream science, and overly enthusiastic about their own fringy alternatives. Many of them believe in researchso long as it is their own. And, of course, the Internet is king. For better or for worse, the Internet gave everyone a voiceflat Earthers included.

For posterity's sake, here's Ars' recent look at reality vs. belief about the shape of the Earth. Click for a full transcript. Until the 17th century, the Fensa broad, flat swath of marshland in eastern Englandwere home only to game-hunters and fishermen. Eventually, though, their value as potential agricultural land became too enticing to ignore, and the Earl of Bedford, along with a number of gentlemen adventurers, signed contracts with Charles I to drain the area, beginning in the 1630s. A series of drainage channels were cut, criss-crossing the wetlands of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. The plan was a qualified success; a vast area was now farmable, though wind-powered pumps were needed to keep the water at bay. The most notable feature of the Fens is their pancake-like topography. Its said that if you climb the tower of Ely Cathedral on a clear day, you can make out the silhouette of Peterborough Cathedral, some 30 miles to the northwest. Indeed, one could see even further if it wasnt for the curvature of the Earth. Enter one Samuel Birley Rowbotham, a 19th-century inventor and quack doctor who went by the name Parallax. Rowbotham believed that the Earth was flat, and that the Fens were the perfect place to prove it. In particular, he set his sights on the Old Bedford River, one of the 17th-century drainage cuts built under the tenure of the Earl of Bedford. The riverits really a canalruns straight as an arrow for some 22 miles, from Earith, Cambridgeshire, to Downham Market, Norfolk, where it meets the River Great Ouse.

          "Theres a scene in the US political thriller House of Cards in which Claire Underwood, played by Robin Wright, goes for a run in a cemetery and, to her shock, is berated for doing so by an elderly woman who is there to mourn. Aside from underlining the moral complexity of Underwoods tough-minded character, the scene speaks to an uneasy sense that, at least in advanced capitalist nations such as the UK and the US, where the processes of secularisation have recently been distinctly uneven, we dont quite know how to behave in places that, in Erin-Marie Legaceys phrase, make space for the dead. I can remember provoking a similar morally outraged reaction when, a decade ago, I took my small children to the local cemetery for a picnic. The adjective liminal, from the Latin limen, a threshold, has for a long time been something of a clich in academic accounts of space, particularly among proponents of postmodernism; but for once it seems genuinely appropriate. The uncertainty and unease we feel in relation to cemeteries is partly because, in their social and symbolic functions, they are so richly ambiguous (the French historian Michel Foucault recognised this when he offered cemeteries as a classic example of those other places that, in troubling the prevailing, broadly rationalist distribution of space in society, he classified as heterotopias). Cemeteries occupy a sort of border territory between a series of oppositions that structure post-Enlightenment thinking. They disturb convenient distinctions between, among other things, the living and the dead, this world and the next, the religious and the secular, the country and the city, the private and the public. It is one of the strengths of Legaceys perceptive monograph on the formal, ritual sites of death in post-Revolutionary Paris, which include the Catacombs and the short-lived Museum of French Monuments, as well as Pre Lachaise Cemetery, that it is sensitive to their contradictoriness both as social spaces and as repositories of what she calls the social imaginary. The cemeteries and Catacombs of the French capital during the 50-year period from 1780, when a royal ordinance first declared the Cemetery of the Holy Innocents a danger to public health, functioned as forceful agents of emerging notions of rationality, sociability and national unity, especially in so far as these entailed a rejection of the Old Regime. Although the Catacombs beneath Paris, which opened to the public in 1809, proved predictably thrilling in their gothic associations, the spaces of the dead so sensitively excavated by Legacey thus conducted utopian energies as well as unsettling heterotopian ones. Pre Lachaise itself, for example, which is at the dead centre of this book so to speak, was established in 1804 not only as a bucolic space that, with its picturesque landscape of tombs and blossoming trees, promised to efface Parisians nightmarish memories of the stinking, suppurating burial pits and graveyards that had threatened public health before and in the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, but as a site of new forms of education and social interaction. Conflating public and private space, it was a place, Legacey argues, where nineteenth-century Parisians took advantage of the cemetery as a powerful liminal zone in the city. Legacey has scrupulously examined the literature on cemeteries from the early 19th century, including influential guidebooks by C.P. Arnaud, Franois-Marie Marchant de Beaumont and others, and infers from these sometimes sentimental publications that Pre Lachaise and the other new spaces of the dead, as she calls them, were designed to be edifying sources of moral and social reconstruction, in which notions of egalitarianism central to the Republic were deliberately promoted. Visitors could reflect on these notions in the form of semi-private, semi-public acts of communing when they read the intimate but at the same time morally instructive epitaphs inscribed on tombstones. In fact, the idea that, within the precincts of Pre Lachaise, the dead were all equal was, of course, an illusion. Unlike the Catacombs, where all distinctions of sex, wealth, and rank have finally disappeared, as Etienne de Jouy justifiably observed in 1812, in Pre Lachaise some of the dead were more equal than others. There were three options for those interring their loved ones, as Legacey explains. The poor could bury them for free in the area alongside the south-western wall of the cemetery, which had been designated public; the rich could purchase perpetual concessions, which guaranteed the deceased a permanent place in the cemetery that could be embellished according to the owners means and desires, at the not inconsiderable price of 100 francs per square metre; and a middling sort, consisting of people who wanted something more private than the mass grave, but who could not afford the exclusive private plots, consequently rented rather than bought what were known as temporary concessions, where the dead were limited, in the first instance, to a five- year tenancy. The contemporaneous literature on Paris pioneering cemeteries, Legacey points out, tended to ignore this stratified structure, interpreting Pre Lachaise in particular as a profoundly unifying cohesive space. Occasionally, however, the horrors both of mortality and inequality irrupted into this polite, politically optimistic consensus in ways that proved impossible to repress. In 1837, for example, as Legacey observes in a postscript to her compelling chapter on Pre Lachaise, an official report noted that, some 30 years after its inception, the burial sites were becoming increasingly hazardous, in part because numerous mourners competed, rather desperately, to mark out individual portions of the mass grave. The mother of one child interred in a picturesque spot in the communal section of the cemetery, it transpired, had been maintaining what she assumed was her daughters grave, but which she discovered was nothing of the sort: An exhumation revealed that the body beneath the garden was that of a young man, while the girls remains were actually located three coffins further down the trench. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living, Karl Marx wrote in The 18th Brumaire of Napoleon Bonaparte (1852). The living generations of Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary France, as Legacey demonstrates in this highly readable, thoughtfully argued reconstruction of the culture of burial and memorial in late 18th- and early 19th-century Paris, were determined that these dead generations, in literal as well as symbolic senses, might serve not to oppress them like a nightmare, but to contribute actively and substantively to their dream of a new regime that was oriented to the future as well as committed to coming to terms with the past.

The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living, Karl Marx wrote in The 18th Brumaire of Napoleon Bonaparte (1852). The living generations of Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary France, as Legacey demonstrates in this highly readable, thoughtfully argued reconstruction of the culture of burial and memorial in late 18th- and early 19th-century Paris, were determined that these dead generations, in literal as well as symbolic senses, might serve not to oppress them like a nightmare, but to contribute actively and substantively to their dream of a new regime that was oriented to the future as well as committed to coming to terms with the past.

          "EM: Accelerating collapse. And then the common rebuttal is like, what about immigration? Like, from where?JM: Yeah, you want to go to Mars...EM: Mars needs people, you know, Mars, people, you know, there's no zero people there right now. It's right now it's the machine planet, there's only some robots there.JM: This is something that we should pay special attentionthat's why the the 18 million new babies born in China, which was less than only like 1 percent of something, we should spend more time creating these people and treat life better. In our company, AI we call Alibaba intelligence because we think when things with order, with things with logic, machines can always do better, AI can do better. But if things wisdom or without logic, human beings can do better. For example, when you love somebody, there's no reason. Normally, I just love him or just love her, I have no reason. But when I hate somebody, when I want to do bad things on something, somebody, there's a logic and when there's logic, AI can do better. We teach machines all the bad things that bad guys want to do. Machines can learn quickly, and arrest all the bad guys immediately. But when you want to do good things, not necessarily.EM: AI means love.JM: That's absolutely right. So that is why the worldif AI can bring love, which I called in the past, if you have the successful person, you have to have EQ and IQ, right? In the future, if you want to survive in this world, you have to be the LQ the Q of love, that's important too. Otherwise cannot survive in that deficient. Talent is time.EM: I agree, love is the answer. There are many songs about that.JM: So you want to talk about machines, life? Or do you want to talk about your cars, autonomy? What do you want to talk?EM: This feels like one of those steps in a video game where you've got like pick a path. I choose life.JM: OK, life. So how much longer do you think people can live with the help of AI? Can AI help with environment sustainability?EM: Well I think first of all, I think humans will solve environmental sustainability, I do not mean to suggest complacency. Or that we just take it easy. In fact, this is a self fulfilling or unfulfilling prophecy. We must take immediate and dramatic action. And continue the momentum towards environmental sustainability. And China is actually the world leader in this. In fact, I'm not sure how well it is known outside of China, just how much China is a world leader in environmental sustainability. Its extremely impressive. I mean, I think half of all the electric cars in the world were made in China last year, or something like that. So you know, so I don't mean to suggest complacency. But I do think humans can and will solve sustainability.If we can, if we can do the Neuralink essentially, age will not matter that much. You can simply save your state and restore your state. Just like a saved game, essentially, something very close to that. I do think we can we can solve biological aging, if we really wanted to, you'd have to make DNA changes, but were obviously just on a on a clock, all organisms are. I mean, you could take a fruit fly, for example. And you could have it do daily yoga, and have a very healthy diet and is still going to live for three weeks, maybe four weeks. So environmental factors are relatively minor for extending life, you have to change the DNA. So the question is, like, will people be OK with changing the DNA? that's the thing about extending life, you know, and probably people are a little bit reluctant about that. But that's essentially the thing that needs to occur to extend life. or you've got to stop the DNA clock somehow. I don't know if we should work on this or not. I think, frankly, you know, it's probably a good thing that we do eventually die. You know, there's a saying, like, in physics, like even physicists, which are generally quite objective, is like, theres a saying that all physicists don't change their mind, they just die. So, maybe, you know, it's good to have this life cycle.JM: I think AI can definitely help the environment sustainability. And when human beings know themselves better, human beings will be smarter and will be wiser. The difference between clever people, and smart people or wise people: smart people knows what he wants, and how he can get it. wise people know what he doesn't want. So when human beings use artificial intelligence, they will understand themselves better. And I think there will be millions of ways people will live in a healthy Earth, and protect the healthy Earth. The reason why I want to stay in this Earth, I want to work on this Earth, I want to do anything I can to help this Earth to better because going to the space is great, but if we can spend our resources, just to focus on helping pick up the garbage from the oceans, that thing is more difficult than going to Mars. But artificial intelligence can help us achieve that, and solve the problems. And the second human being can live better, can live longer. But what we need is not only to live longer, we want to live healthier. How can we live healthier, is to understand us better. Most of the disease is caused by our behavior. So I'm 100 percent sure people will live longer, people will live healthier, but may not necessarily live happier. If you want to be happier, human beings are focused on value, the vision and the mission, and always have dreams. And I don't want people love technology and put their dreams on the technology. I think that technology should be with dreams. It's not technology that changes the world, its the dreams behind the technologies that change the world. So my hope is that anything we can do to improve this world, to helping 7.4 billion people live better, live healthier. And this is all about our world. And I think what will be working very happily because I love your product, Tesla. You know making world cleaner, and no noise and such great technology. I'm happy you have the factory in China. And I think we need to do more things to improve this Earth, improve this world, and make sure that that people are happier, and people care about the family, people care about the health. That's all we should do. And trust us, trust a human beings, and trust young people. Let's take responsibility for today. But let's not take away all the solutions for tomorrow. It's great human beings make mistakes. It's great human beings learn from mistakes. It's great to die.More Great WIRED StoriesWe can be heroes: How nerds are reinventing pop cultureWhy on earth is water in Hawaii's Kilauea volcano?Jeffrey Epstein and the power of networksI replaced my oven with a waffle maker and you should, tooLearn how to fall with climber Alex Honnold Facial recognition is suddenly everywhere.

          "This story was part of our January 2019 issueThe video encryption was conventional, not quantum, but because the quantum keys were required to decrypt it, its security was guaranteed. This made it the worlds very first quantum-encrypted intercontinental video link.The man behind this achievement is Jian-Wei Pan. A professor at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), sometimes known as Chinas Caltech, 48-year-old Pan has produced a series of breakthroughs that have propelled him to scientific stardom in the country. His work has won plaudits from President Xi Jinping, and hes often referred to in local media as the father of quantum.Quantum communications and computing are still nascent, but they are among the technological megaprojects on which Chinas government wants breakthroughs by 2030. It sees an opportunity to lead the dawning quantum era in much the same way that the US dominated the advent of computing and the information revolution that it sparked.Pan, who in 2011 became the youngest-ever member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is central to this effort.In an interview with MIT Technology Review, Pan talked about the importance of international collaboration, but he also made clear that China sees a unique window for it to shape the next meta-shift in the technology landscape. We were only the follower and the learner at the birth of modern information science, he said. Now we have a chance to be a leader.Pans ambitions include a plan to create a globe-spanning constellation of satellites that constitute a super-secure quantum internet. Also on his checklist: helping China catch up withand perhaps overtakethe US in building powerful quantum computers. The fundamental units of computation in these machines are qubits, whichunlike bitscan occupy a quantum state of 1 and 0 simultaneously. By linking qubits through an almost mystical phenomenon known as entanglement, quantum computers can generate exponential increases in processing power.In the future, the machines could be used to discover new materials and drugs by running simulations of chemical reactions that are too much work for classical computers. They could also turbocharge artificial intelligence. Secure networks using quantum key distribution (QKD) could transmit sensitive data for things like financial transactions and provide utmost secrecy for military operations and communications. Researchers are also working on quantum sensors that would let submarines navigate without relying on satellite signals, and quantum radar that may be able to spot stealth aircraft. The picture of the receiver shows a spotting laser used to help the satellite connect to the ground station. Joint effortsDespite the intense US-China competition in quantum technologies, the video call made possible by the Micius satellitenamed for an ancient Chinese scientist and philosopheris very much a result of international cooperation.It came out of a collaboration between a team led by Pan and another led by Anton Zeilinger, a quantum physicist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Zeilinger was Pans doctoral supervisor in the 1990s, and he saw potential in the young Chinese student. When he came here, he was one hundred percent focused on theoretical physics, recalls Zeilinger. But I realized he could do more, so I suggested he switch to experiments, and he did that very successfully.So successfully, in fact, that Zeilinger was only too happy when his former student proposed a collaboration on intercontinental QKD in 2011. Pans team had already conducted experiments over a number of years to prove a space-based system could work, and it eventually got the Chinese governments green light to build a dedicated satellite, which was launched in 2016.Making QKD work on the ground is hard enough. Doing it from a satellite meant solving a host of extra problems, from aligning the satellites transmissions precisely with the ground stations to minimizing the number of photons lost in the atmosphere. Observers were impressed, says Hoi-Kwong Lo, a physics professor at the University of Toronto. He adds, Theres a huge amount of resources being devoted to quantum in China, which means they can do things other countries cant. Pan foresees a day when data centers on different continents will be connected via the quantum satellites hes planning. Chinas other achievements include building the worlds longest terrestrial QKD network. The 2,032-kilometer (1,263-mile) ground link between Beijing and Shanghai was also masterminded by Pan and sends quantum-encrypted keys between way stations, offering an ultra-secure network for transmitting financial and other sensitive data. Some Chinese cities are also building municipal networks.Gauging exactly how much China is investing in these and other quantum projects is hard because funding for government programs is opaque. But Pan says the money devoted to an upcoming national quantum plan for China will be at least the same order of magnitude as Europes recently launched Quantum Technologies Flagship project, a 10-year, 1 billion ($1.1 billion) initiative.While money matters, theres more to Chinas success than the bankrolling of satellites and other projects. The country also benefits from a decades-long strategy of sending young researchers abroad to learn from experts like Zeilinger and then enticing them home to continue their work.China is producing plenty of high-quality quantum science papers, and the number of Chinese patents being registered in areas like quantum communications and quantum cryptography has also soared, far surpassing those being registered in the US and elsewhere.To help develop future quantum researchers, the country is building a $1 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei that will open in 2020; it will bring together experts from a range of disciplines such as physics, electrical engineering, and materials science. Some of the money will be for a new USTC campus on the same site to train quantum researchers. We are working hard to develop the workforce of the future in quantum technology, says Pan.Hes already created a center for quantum information and quantum physics at USTC. In June 2018 a team at the center announced it had set a world record for entangling qubits, linking 18 together. Advances like this will bring us closer to the point at which a quantum machine will finally be able to outstrip even the most powerful conventional supercomputer for certain tasks.There are also ambitious plans to scale up efforts in space. Pan says that over the next four to five years, China will launch four more low-orbit quantum satellites, and a high-orbit geostationary one will follow shortly thereafter. The long-term vision is to create a continent-spanning, quantum-secured internet that could eclipse todays version. Looking much further ahead, the technology could one day be used to secure everything from smartphones to laptops. Jian-Wei Pan, standing in front of a receiver used in the transmission of ultra-secure signals from the Micius satellite, has helped lead Chinas quantum efforts. Leader and laggardSo is China really set to dominate the emerging quantum era? And what will it do with that dominance if so?The answer to the first of those questions is nuanced. While Micius and the ground-based QKD networks give China the edgefor nowin secure quantum communications, it still trails the US in quantum computing. However, as Pans teams success with entangling qubits shows, its making swift progress. Big Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Baidu are investing heavily in quantum computing, too. Alibaba has launched a cloud computing service that lets people experiment on quantum processors, mirroring similar efforts by US companies such as IBM and Rigetti.Isaac Chuang, an MIT professor and pioneer of quantum computing, notes that one of the reasons China has done so well in quantum science is the close coordination between its government research groups, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the countrys universities. Europe now has its own quantum master plan to prompt such collaborations, but the US has been slow to produce a comprehensive strategy for developing the technologies and building a future quantum workforce.Whatever happens elsewhere, China will press forward. Pan emphasizes commercial opportunities. Businesses are already using the Beijing-Shanghai network to ship information securely. And he foresees a day when data centers on different continents will be connected via the constellation of quantum satellites hes planning.Those satellites, of course, could also be used for military purposes. Elsa Kania at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, DC, think tank, says various parts of Chinas armed forces are funding research into quantum communications, sensors, and radar. Big companies like China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, one of the countrys largest builders of warships and submarines, are working with universities on quantum projects. If China thinks the technology could give it a military edge, it might pull back on international collaborations and keep innovations to itself.A more optimistic view sees China remaining open to the kinds of interchanges that have helped turn it into a quantum superpower, and doing its utmost to profit from a new, quantum-inspired data economy. The notion that China could seize the lead here seems to inspire its top officials: Xi Jinping has even talked publicly of quantum science opening up a new industrial revolution.Whichever scenario ultimately plays out, China will be counting heavily on the father of quantum to steer it to success.Correction: An earlier version of this articlesaid that Anton Zeilinger is a quantum physicist at theUniversity of Austria. He is in fact at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. ",

The fundamental units of computation in these machines are qubits, whichunlike bitscan occupy a quantum state of 1 and 0 simultaneously. By linking qubits through an almost mystical phenomenon known as entanglement, quantum computers can generate exponential increases in processing power.In the future, the machines could be used to discover new materials and drugs by running simulations of chemical reactions that are too much work for classical computers. They could also turbocharge artificial intelligence. Secure networks using quantum key distribution (QKD) could transmit sensitive data for things like financial transactions and provide utmost secrecy for military operations and communications. Researchers are also working on quantum sensors that would let submarines navigate without relying on satellite signals, and quantum radar that may be able to spot stealth aircraft. The picture of the receiver shows a spotting laser used to help the satellite connect to the ground station. Joint effortsDespite the intense US-China competition in quantum technologies, the video call made possible by the Micius satellitenamed for an ancient Chinese scientist and philosopheris very much a result of international cooperation.It came out of a collaboration between a team led by Pan and another led by Anton Zeilinger, a quantum physicist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Zeilinger was Pans doctoral supervisor in the 1990s, and he saw potential in the young Chinese student. When he came here, he was one hundred percent focused on theoretical physics, recalls Zeilinger. But I realized he could do more, so I suggested he switch to experiments, and he did that very successfully.So successfully, in fact, that Zeilinger was only too happy when his former student proposed a collaboration on intercontinental QKD in 2011. Pans team had already conducted experiments over a number of years to prove a space-based system could work, and it eventually got the Chinese governments green light to build a dedicated satellite, which was launched in 2016.Making QKD work on the ground is hard enough. Doing it from a satellite meant solving a host of extra problems, from aligning the satellites transmissions precisely with the ground stations to minimizing the number of photons lost in the atmosphere. Observers were impressed, says Hoi-Kwong Lo, a physics professor at the University of Toronto. He adds, Theres a huge amount of resources being devoted to quantum in China, which means they can do things other countries cant. Pan foresees a day when data centers on different continents will be connected via the quantum satellites hes planning. Chinas other achievements include building the worlds longest terrestrial QKD network. The 2,032-kilometer (1,263-mile) ground link between Beijing and Shanghai was also masterminded by Pan and sends quantum-encrypted keys between way stations, offering an ultra-secure network for transmitting financial and other sensitive data. Some Chinese cities are also building municipal networks.Gauging exactly how much China is investing in these and other quantum projects is hard because funding for government programs is opaque. But Pan says the money devoted to an upcoming national quantum plan for China will be at least the same order of magnitude as Europes recently launched Quantum Technologies Flagship project, a 10-year, 1 billion ($1.1 billion) initiative.While money matters, theres more to Chinas success than the bankrolling of satellites and other projects. The country also benefits from a decades-long strategy of sending young researchers abroad to learn from experts like Zeilinger and then enticing them home to continue their work.China is producing plenty of high-quality quantum science papers, and the number of Chinese patents being registered in areas like quantum communications and quantum cryptography has also soared, far surpassing those being registered in the US and elsewhere.To help develop future quantum researchers, the country is building a $1 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei that will open in 2020; it will bring together experts from a range of disciplines such as physics, electrical engineering, and materials science. Some of the money will be for a new USTC campus on the same site to train quantum researchers. We are working hard to develop the workforce of the future in quantum technology, says Pan.Hes already created a center for quantum information and quantum physics at USTC. In June 2018 a team at the center announced it had set a world record for entangling qubits, linking 18 together. Advances like this will bring us closer to the point at which a quantum machine will finally be able to outstrip even the most powerful conventional supercomputer for certain tasks.There are also ambitious plans to scale up efforts in space. Pan says that over the next four to five years, China will launch four more low-orbit quantum satellites, and a high-orbit geostationary one will follow shortly thereafter. The long-term vision is to create a continent-spanning, quantum-secured internet that could eclipse todays version. Looking much further ahead, the technology could one day be used to secure everything from smartphones to laptops. Jian-Wei Pan, standing in front of a receiver used in the transmission of ultra-secure signals from the Micius satellite, has helped lead Chinas quantum efforts. Leader and laggardSo is China really set to dominate the emerging quantum era? And what will it do with that dominance if so?The answer to the first of those questions is nuanced. While Micius and the ground-based QKD networks give China the edgefor nowin secure quantum communications, it still trails the US in quantum computing. However, as Pans teams success with entangling qubits shows, its making swift progress. Big Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Baidu are investing heavily in quantum computing, too. Alibaba has launched a cloud computing service that lets people experiment on quantum processors, mirroring similar efforts by US companies such as IBM and Rigetti.Isaac Chuang, an MIT professor and pioneer of quantum computing, notes that one of the reasons China has done so well in quantum science is the close coordination between its government research groups, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the countrys universities. Europe now has its own quantum master plan to prompt such collaborations, but the US has been slow to produce a comprehensive strategy for developing the technologies and building a future quantum workforce.Whatever happens elsewhere, China will press forward. Pan emphasizes commercial opportunities. Businesses are already using the Beijing-Shanghai network to ship information securely. And he foresees a day when data centers on different continents will be connected via the constellation of quantum satellites hes planning.Those satellites, of course, could also be used for military purposes. Elsa Kania at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, DC, think tank, says various parts of Chinas armed forces are funding research into quantum communications, sensors, and radar. Big companies like China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, one of the countrys largest builders of warships and submarines, are working with universities on quantum projects. If China thinks the technology could give it a military edge, it might pull back on international collaborations and keep innovations to itself.A more optimistic view sees China remaining open to the kinds of interchanges that have helped turn it into a quantum superpower, and doing its utmost to profit from a new, quantum-inspired data economy. The notion that China could seize the lead here seems to inspire its top officials: Xi Jinping has even talked publicly of quantum science opening up a new industrial revolution.Whichever scenario ultimately plays out, China will be counting heavily on the father of quantum to steer it to success.Correction: An earlier version of this articlesaid that Anton Zeilinger is a quantum physicist at theUniversity of Austria. He is in fact at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. ",

          "https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/5/20849020/alaska-permanent-fund-universal-basic-income",
          "What if we just give people money? This is the question propelling several new books and thats been taken up by more than one presidential candidate foremost Andrew Yang, who has made universal basic income (UBI) the centerpiece of his campaign. An automated future looms on the horizon, and tech magnates and policy wonks are turning to UBI as a neat solution to the messy problem of technology-induced unemployment. Yet when one considers the political ramifications of the largest and longest-running UBI experiment in America Alaskas Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) giving out cash appears to create unforeseen problems, and advocates for basic income would do well to incorporate Alaskas latest experience into their conceptions of the policy. Since 1982, Alaska has been giving every woman, man, and child an annual chunk of its nest egg: the $66.3 billion Permanent Fund. Alaska deposits at least 25 percent of mineral royalties revenue the state generates from its mines, oil, and gas reserves into the fund annually. The money is in turn invested by the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation in domestic and global stock, bonds, private equity, and more, and interest earnings are then distributed to Alaska residents every September. Former Gov. Jay Hammond, the mastermind behind the fund, created the dividend system as a way to ensure Alaskas nonrenewable resources could provide an everlasting return to the state. In his words, he wanted to transform oil wells pumping oil for a finite period into money wells pumping money for infinity. Paying out $1,000 to $2,000 per person per year every Alaskan gets the same amount was Hammonds plan to protect the fund. If every Alaskan were a stakeholder in the Permanent Funds future, surely no politician could dismantle it without paying an electoral price. For decades, Hammonds system was an unprecedented success. But in 2015, plunging oil prices created major shortfalls in the states budget. In response, then-Gov. Bill Walker deviated from the traditional PFD formula and reduced the value of the check for 2016. Doing so allowed the government to continue funding state services and ensured the sustainability of the fund. Instead of a check for $2,052, as they would have received with the traditional formula, Alaskans that year got a comparatively paltry $1,022. In 2018, Republican state Sen. Mike Dunleavy saw an opportunity. Despite traditional Republican aversions to handouts, Dunleavy ran for governor on the campaign platform of increasing the PFD. He promised every resident up to $6,700, to make up for Walkers cuts in 2016 and 2017 though he was foggy on how the state could pay. The result? Dunleavy won by a landslide. The problem is that he now finds himself unable to fulfill his campaign promise without major cuts elsewhere. Hes now seeking to jettison other state commitments to health care, education, infrastructure, and other vital areas. After initially vetoing $444 million from the state budget, Dunleavy responded to the threat of a recall vote and walked back some of his more extreme line-item cuts. Still, the state will see no funding for public broadcasting, a 31 percent cut to its critical ferry system, $130 million from Medicaid, and $70 million from the University of Alaska system. The PFD allowed Dunleavy to turn the governors race into a single-issue vote: Do you want a bigger check or not? The events in Alaska show that a UBI policy can have a dramatic effect on an economy but it can also overwhelm all other governmental concerns and dominate politics. The complicated politics of the Alaska Permanent Fund To supporters of a UBI, the Alaska PFD offers a tantalizing glimpse of what a universal basic income can do. Thanks to the PFD, crippling poverty is scant in Alaska. A 2016 study by the University of Alaska found it reduced poverty up to 20 percent. However, Alaskans finances are insecure in other ways. High unemployment (the highest in the country) and the astronomical cost of rural living meant that even voters who were concerned about the feasibility of Dunleavys $6,700 pledge voted for him anyway. A couple thousand bucks might not sound like basic income, but for many rural Alaskans, a big PFD can mean the difference between a year of hunger and a year of plenty. In the end, Dunleavys $6,700 was an offer too high to refuse. But on top of all the cuts hes pushed, Dunleavy agreed on August 20 to the $1,600 PFD that was passed by the legislature meaning Alaskans still wont get the check they thought they were voting for, because contrary to Dunleavys campaign messaging, the governor does not actually hold the power to set the value of the dividend. (Only the legislature does.) The upheavals in Alaska illustrate how the PFD has come to warp the states politics. It has allowed a feckless politician to capitalize on residents economic insecurities and reach the states highest office. Alaska is one of the closest test cases we have for UBI, and interested parties should note the political and social costs that Alaskas PFD is accruing. Once a government adopts such a policy, it may well become the preeminent issue in future campaigns. As Anchorage Daily News commentator Charles Wohlforth wrote, It took only a year or two before the fund became politically sacrosanct. Alaska is not a perfect analog to the United States as a whole. The state has no income or sales tax and is loath to implement either. Andrew Yangs Freedom Dividend plan relies on dedicated tax revenue, which would be subject to fewer vicissitudes than oil markets. It is also improbable the US would find itself in a similar budgetary bind that would pit funding for public services against a UBI. The US can borrow in huge numbers and perform financial wizardry that a lone state cannot. However, Alaskas political composition means it is a better test case for UBI than any small-scale randomized controlled trial, since it allows observers to study not only the economic and social ramifications of UBI but also its effects in the political arena. Republicans control the government of Alaska just as they now control the US federal government and Republicans tend to defund public services and thwart attempts to raise taxes on the wealthy. Any viable American UBI policy would have to grapple with the same temptations on the part of conservative politicians to use UBI to get elected and then as an excuse to strip public funding from programs they dont like. The situation unfolding in Alaska demonstrates how economic precarity, paired with an entrenched reliance on an annual check, can result in deep political dysfunction. How might the government salvage this vital yet troublesome program? Alaskan lawmakers have proposed codifying the formula for the dividend check amount in the state constitution as a way of settling its perennial political battles. In theory, this would isolate the PFD from opportunistic politicians, but the reality would be more complicated. How exactly to calculate the amount alone is a vexing and deeply political question. Introducing more rigidity to the process might make the state even less adaptable to oil market fluctuations. None of this is to say Alaska should do away with the PFD, or that UBI activists should abandon their cause. Aspects of the PFD show tremendous promise for a similar nationwide program it signals the US would see reduced poverty, a buoyed economy, a greater sense of ownership over the country. But these UBI enthusiasts should pay attention to the curdling effects the PFD has had on Alaskas politics, and how it has left elections vulnerable to candidates willing to make unkeepable promises. Cash is a uniquely motivating incentive. The Alaska governors race indicates UBI would be a mobilizer of votes beyond what other proposals might achieve. And because UBI does not have the same tinge of big government as other entitlements, conservative political movements can readily claim UBI for their own and use it as a cudgel to dismantle public programs. Alaska demonstrates that when you start giving people money, the act may very well eclipse every other political concern and blot out all other missions of government.

          "Groups of citizens regularly exercise the right to assemble, but too often American political and cultural leaders ignore it.Chris Lee / VII Mentor Program / ReduxAbout the author: John Inazu is the Sally D. Danforth Distinguished Professor of Law and Religion at Washington University in St. Louis. He is the author of Confident Pluralism: Surviving and Thriving Through Deep Difference. In the past few months, protesters in Hong Kong have engaged in a citywide strike. In Lebanon, mass protests led to the prime ministers resignation. In India, nationwide protests have defied government restrictions on public gatherings. Meanwhile, protesters in other parts of the world remain forcibly subduedsuch as in Chinese reeducation camps and Saudi prisons. These examples, reflecting a range of lawful and unlawful assemblies, and the denial of assembly altogether, reveal the importance and the risks of the right to do so.The right of assembly allows people to form and gather in groups of their choosing, and to publicly express their values and beliefs even when they conflict with the views of the majority. In the United States, this right finds an uneven reception: Groups of citizens regularly exercise it, but too often American political and cultural leaders ignore it. In recent years, state and local law officials illegally shut down protests in Ferguson, Missouri; the American Civil Liberties Union failed to support a protester outside a Massachusetts abortion clinic; and the New York Police Department sent undercover agents to infiltrate Muslim student groups. Public universities have deregistered Christian groups that wanted their members to share their beliefs, Republicans have threatened to strip Planned Parenthood of its tax-exempt status, and Democrats have pledged to do the same to conservative religious organizations. And President Donald Trump has attempted to limit political protests against him. Americans across the political spectrum confront restrictions and limitations on their right to assembly.Read more: The power of in-person protestingWhat went wrong with the protections for Americas public expressions and private groups, and why does it matter? Put simply, American law and practice have lost sight of the importance of protecting difference and dissent. Local officials too frequently end protests prematurely or move them to distant locations where they will be less effective. Lawmakers overregulate nonviolent groups that resist majoritarian norms. And many Americans cede too easily to the demands of conformity rather than pursuing and protecting alternative visions of society. As a result, many modern American protest movements lack the sustained engagement that unfolds elsewhere in the world.Part of the problem is judicial inattention: The Supreme Court has not addressed the scope or meaning of the First Amendments right of the people peaceably to assemble since 1983. Instead, protests and demonstrations are now governed by free-speech doctrine, which ignores the right of assembly and neglects the importance of collective expression. Meanwhile, a core part of the right to assemblethe right to create private groups as part of civil societyfalls mostly under the judicially recognized right of association. This right was first recognized by the Supreme Court only in 1958, with little analysis to support it. By cordoning off the right to form and maintain groups to a new and undertheorized right, the Supreme Court weakened both the right to assemble itself, and the intellectual discourse that gives it life.The Founders had a different approach, as I document in my 2012 book, Libertys Refuge: The Forgotten Freedom of Assembly. In one of the lesser-known exchanges in the First Congress debating the Bill of Rights, Thomas Hartley of Pennsylvania sparred with Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts about whether the First Amendment should include a right of assembly. The draft text then before the House of Representatives provided that the people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good. Hartley endorsed that wording, suggesting that assembly should extend to every thing that was not incompatible with the general good. Gerry responded that if Hartley meant to say that the people merely had a right to consult for the common good but could not consult unless they met for that purpose, he was in fact contend[ing] for nothing. The First Congress soon dropped the common-good limitation.As Gerry recognized, and the First Congress eventually acknowledged, a core purpose of the right of assembly is to allow people to resist majoritarian understandings of the common good. This basic recognition is an essential part of living in a diverse society where different beliefs lead citizens to different thoughts on what is best for their country, its people, and its communities. Despite widespread political invocations today of the common good by politicians and pundits, not everyone agrees on the purpose of the United States, the definition of a human being, or the nature of human flourishing. These are not small questions. Americans can identify certain political goods, such as interstate highways and national defense. But as the theologian Luke Bretherton has noted, attempting to name the common good of a nation as large and diverse as America denies the plurality and contestability of moral visions in complex societies and the conflicts that arise in pursuit of divergent moral goods, all of which must be negotiated through politics.Negotiating conflicts through politics inevitably produces winners and losersthose elected to office and those defeated, those who benefit from policies and those who suffer under them. But no matter who prevails in the political process, a democratic government must protect the groups and spaces where people can continue to pursue and express their alternative visions of the common good. This commitment is not cost-free. The right to protest risks disruption, instability, and possible political change. The ability to form and maintain groups of peoples choosing means some groups will exclude those who dont share their beliefs and values. Tolerating assemblies that do not advance majoritarian understandings of the common good means tolerating expression and practices that the majority may not like.The right of assembly is as important today as it was at Americas founding, and in some ways the challenges to its lived expression have become only more difficult. President Trumps rhetoric toward those opposing his policies signals an executive branch dismissive of dissent and disagreement. Public protests place enormous burdens on law enforcement in light of more powerful and more lethal weapons brandished by private citizens. At the same time, the increased militarization and surveillance tactics used by law enforcement burden protesters, bystanders, and journalists. Virtual assemblies that would have been unimaginable to the First Congress now connect Americans relationally and politicallyand there is reason to doubt that the massive private corporations on which Americans depend for these online assemblies will extend the equivalent of First Amendment protections to their users.From 1919: The threatened eclipse of free speechA commitment to assembly is not without limits. For one thing, the First Amendment protects only the right of peaceable assembly. Under well-established law, local authorities and law enforcement can restrict assemblies that threaten imminent incitement to lawbreaking and violence. There is a good case to be made that the tiki-torch marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, transgressed the bounds of peaceable assembly even prior to the death and destruction that followed. And when protesters against police violence shut down a highway or trespass onto private property, local law enforcement is well within its limits to intervene.But these outer constraints still leave a lot of breathing room for difference and dissent. That breathing room will be secured only with bipartisan and cross-ideological support for the right of peaceable assembly, no matter the politics or party, no matter the discomfort or angst. Americas courts, legislatures, and local policy makers will need to revisit and revise laws and regulations affecting assemblies, including vague restrictions on unlawful assembly. And Americans of all political stripes can choose to exercise the right of assembly as a peaceable but firm reminder that e pluribus unum was always more aspirational than embodied, knowing that the many must still work to live together in spite of their differences.

        "url_text": "Groups of citizens regularly exercise the right to assemble, but too often American political and cultural leaders ignore it.Chris Lee / VII Mentor Program / ReduxAbout the author: John Inazu is the Sally D. Danforth Distinguished Professor of Law and Religion at Washington University in St. Louis. He is the author of Confident Pluralism: Surviving and Thriving Through Deep Difference. In the past few months, protesters in Hong Kong have engaged in a citywide strike. In Lebanon, mass protests led to the prime ministers resignation. In India, nationwide protests have defied government restrictions on public gatherings. Meanwhile, protesters in other parts of the world remain forcibly subduedsuch as in Chinese reeducation camps and Saudi prisons. These examples, reflecting a range of lawful and unlawful assemblies, and the denial of assembly altogether, reveal the importance and the risks of the right to do so.The right of assembly allows people to form and gather in groups of their choosing, and to publicly express their values and beliefs even when they conflict with the views of the majority. In the United States, this right finds an uneven reception: Groups of citizens regularly exercise it, but too often American political and cultural leaders ignore it. In recent years, state and local law officials illegally shut down protests in Ferguson, Missouri; the American Civil Liberties Union failed to support a protester outside a Massachusetts abortion clinic; and the New York Police Department sent undercover agents to infiltrate Muslim student groups. Public universities have deregistered Christian groups that wanted their members to share their beliefs, Republicans have threatened to strip Planned Parenthood of its tax-exempt status, and Democrats have pledged to do the same to conservative religious organizations. And President Donald Trump has attempted to limit political protests against him. Americans across the political spectrum confront restrictions and limitations on their right to assembly.Read more: The power of in-person protestingWhat went wrong with the protections for Americas public expressions and private groups, and why does it matter? Put simply, American law and practice have lost sight of the importance of protecting difference and dissent. Local officials too frequently end protests prematurely or move them to distant locations where they will be less effective. Lawmakers overregulate nonviolent groups that resist majoritarian norms. And many Americans cede too easily to the demands of conformity rather than pursuing and protecting alternative visions of society. As a result, many modern American protest movements lack the sustained engagement that unfolds elsewhere in the world.Part of the problem is judicial inattention: The Supreme Court has not addressed the scope or meaning of the First Amendments right of the people peaceably to assemble since 1983. Instead, protests and demonstrations are now governed by free-speech doctrine, which ignores the right of assembly and neglects the importance of collective expression. Meanwhile, a core part of the right to assemblethe right to create private groups as part of civil societyfalls mostly under the judicially recognized right of association. This right was first recognized by the Supreme Court only in 1958, with little analysis to support it. By cordoning off the right to form and maintain groups to a new and undertheorized right, the Supreme Court weakened both the right to assemble itself, and the intellectual discourse that gives it life.The Founders had a different approach, as I document in my 2012 book, Libertys Refuge: The Forgotten Freedom of Assembly. In one of the lesser-known exchanges in the First Congress debating the Bill of Rights, Thomas Hartley of Pennsylvania sparred with Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts about whether the First Amendment should include a right of assembly. The draft text then before the House of Representatives provided that the people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good. Hartley endorsed that wording, suggesting that assembly should extend to every thing that was not incompatible with the general good. Gerry responded that if Hartley meant to say that the people merely had a right to consult for the common good but could not consult unless they met for that purpose, he was in fact contend[ing] for nothing. The First Congress soon dropped the common-good limitation.As Gerry recognized, and the First Congress eventually acknowledged, a core purpose of the right of assembly is to allow people to resist majoritarian understandings of the common good. This basic recognition is an essential part of living in a diverse society where different beliefs lead citizens to different thoughts on what is best for their country, its people, and its communities. Despite widespread political invocations today of the common good by politicians and pundits, not everyone agrees on the purpose of the United States, the definition of a human being, or the nature of human flourishing. These are not small questions. Americans can identify certain political goods, such as interstate highways and national defense. But as the theologian Luke Bretherton has noted, attempting to name the common good of a nation as large and diverse as America denies the plurality and contestability of moral visions in complex societies and the conflicts that arise in pursuit of divergent moral goods, all of which must be negotiated through politics.Negotiating conflicts through politics inevitably produces winners and losersthose elected to office and those defeated, those who benefit from policies and those who suffer under them. But no matter who prevails in the political process, a democratic government must protect the groups and spaces where people can continue to pursue and express their alternative visions of the common good. This commitment is not cost-free. The right to protest risks disruption, instability, and possible political change. The ability to form and maintain groups of peoples choosing means some groups will exclude those who dont share their beliefs and values. Tolerating assemblies that do not advance majoritarian understandings of the common good means tolerating expression and practices that the majority may not like.The right of assembly is as important today as it was at Americas founding, and in some ways the challenges to its lived expression have become only more difficult. President Trumps rhetoric toward those opposing his policies signals an executive branch dismissive of dissent and disagreement. Public protests place enormous burdens on law enforcement in light of more powerful and more lethal weapons brandished by private citizens. At the same time, the increased militarization and surveillance tactics used by law enforcement burden protesters, bystanders, and journalists. Virtual assemblies that would have been unimaginable to the First Congress now connect Americans relationally and politicallyand there is reason to doubt that the massive private corporations on which Americans depend for these online assemblies will extend the equivalent of First Amendment protections to their users.From 1919: The threatened eclipse of free speechA commitment to assembly is not without limits. For one thing, the First Amendment protects only the right of peaceable assembly. Under well-established law, local authorities and law enforcement can restrict assemblies that threaten imminent incitement to lawbreaking and violence. There is a good case to be made that the tiki-torch marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, transgressed the bounds of peaceable assembly even prior to the death and destruction that followed. And when protesters against police violence shut down a highway or trespass onto private property, local law enforcement is well within its limits to intervene.But these outer constraints still leave a lot of breathing room for difference and dissent. That breathing room will be secured only with bipartisan and cross-ideological support for the right of peaceable assembly, no matter the politics or party, no matter the discomfort or angst. Americas courts, legislatures, and local policy makers will need to revisit and revise laws and regulations affecting assemblies, including vague restrictions on unlawful assembly. And Americans of all political stripes can choose to exercise the right of assembly as a peaceable but firm reminder that e pluribus unum was always more aspirational than embodied, knowing that the many must still work to live together in spite of their differences.

          "Andrew Spear This is my life: I work the graveyard shift for a beverage distributor outside Cleveland, Ohio. Thirty hours a week I'm making the world safe for carbonated refreshment. Or at least three counties of it. Job, life same difference. Basically, I'm a yard monkey, climbing around inside semitrailers in the dark with a flashlight, checking pallet tickets against the product loaded, matching invoices. When I'm satisfied everything's jake, I toss in a dock plate, set the load lock, and seal 'em up. Then I log everything truck, load, and seal numbers for the dispatcher and hop up into the next trailer. And the next. And the next. No job's perfect, this one especially. I'm fifty-nine. The first two hours of my shift are spent outside. You work outdoors in a Great Lakes winter and you know cold mind-fogging, finger-stiffening cold. In the summer you head off to work just as the sidewalk cafs and patio bars are filling up, driving past laughing guys and girls with bare shoulders studying the appetizer menu. I don't know which season is worse. That may sound fairly grim, careerwise: the last splash of a clumsy diver. I have done other things. For better money. In the sunshine. But long before those jobs withered and they did, as all things planted in the Rust Belt inevitably do I had a hunch I'd end up on the dark side. Actually, I knew. I lost a loading job in the winter of 2008. The contemporary job-search experience can best be summed up by the phrase \"part-time man.\" I saw that scrawled on an index card thumbtacked to a job board: \"Seeking Part-time Man.\" First thing, you take a number and get in line with the rest of the unemployed. Then you look at the number in your hand 14,000,000. To move up the line, you have to reinvent yourself. Kind of like a pitcher who's losing his fastball. You find a new pitch. Mine was this: No job's too hard. And you move up the line a little. Decide that the only answer to every question is \"Yes, sir\" and you move up a little more. Working nights was a practical decision; jobs are easier to come by if you'll take a shift most people wouldn't touch. Still, it took five months to find this gig. You sleep the daylight away, but there are perks. Being productive, making your own way in a little world, being heard in the larger one there's enough slack talk around about the rewards of sweat labor to fill a sociol-ogy textbook. A lot of it is charming nonsense; a nugget or two may even be true. Here's what I know: Every man needs an arena, and this is mine. I pull into the lot at sundown. The guys are stripping trailers. From the street they look like a pirate crew sacking a merchant fleet. There's Mr. Tommy, the motor driver, eighteen years under this Big Top, who's forgotten more about the soda-pop business than the board of directors will ever know. Jerry has a saltwater aquarium at home and is raising a shark. Joe owns maybe one piece of apparel that doesn't sport a Chief Wahoo. He has the same sense of humor as me dry and twisted which helps if you're a Tribe fan. Big Rick favors a biker's bandanna and looks like Monsieur Zig-Zag on growth hormones. He's the king of sports trivia; ask him what number Archie Griffin wore and he'll say, \"Ohio State or the pros?\" Then there's Rob, my buddy Rob. Rob trails dreadlocks, speaks fluent Bob Marley, and always surprises. He's a cabbage wizard, and if there's a rarer bird than a Rastafarian who cooks Bavarian, I haven't found one. Dario and Danny are the newbies. I don't know much about them. I don't have to. Derek the night manager is a Steelers fan and has a little shrine to Franco Harris in his office. Here in Browns Town it's the subject of scorn and the object of the occasional black ops. Derek doesn't say much. He's the boss. He doesn't have to. This is my stage: Cinder-block walls and a concrete floor under a corrugated roof maybe forty feet overhead. Wooden pallets of product are stacked nearly to the ceiling six-packs, twelve-packs, twenty-four-packs, thirty-twos. Two-liter bottles rest in trays of eight, twenty-ounce bottles wait in plastic shells. There is juice squeezed from every fruit you can imagine and a few I think someone's made up. A sea of soda. The builders chug down the aisles, dragging pallet jacks, studying the pull tickets in their free hands. A dozen diet-cola twelve-packs check. Root beer. Teas diet, lemon, sweetened, and not. They stack and move on. The job is no different from a supermarket run to get a sense, try pulling a couple of two-liter bottles off a store shelf and tossing them into your shopping cart. Repeat that two thousand times in an eight-hour shift and you've got an idea of the work. Tommy rolls past. He's been outside loading. The cab of his forklift is covered by a plastic tarp. Thunder booms. He shouts a greeting that marks him as a lifelong Clevelander: \"At least it's not snowing.\" I pull up the hood of my sweatshirt and splash out into the yard. Rain is falling in sheets. Christ. On the shop radio Supertramp is advising I take the long way home. The bull waits, pawing the ground. The matador strides to the center of the ring. The bull lifts its head and says, \"So tell me a little about yourself.\" I hated job interviews: clammy handshakes followed by the moment of truth. Well, I'd say, there's little to tell. I was born to sweat. I grew up in a blue-collar Cleveland neighborhood, a little bit of Old Europe transplanted onto a bend of the Cuyahoga River. The men Poles, Slovaks, Czechs, Ukies, Hungarians were scrappers and needed to be. Their wives stayed home, had gardens and babies, and could see the future in the bottoms of teacups. I never needed a fortune-teller to see mine. It came shuffling past our porch every evening at 5:25, toting a lunch pail. At eighteen you were swallowed by the python and made your way through the beast like a lump. At the other end was a mill pension, casino trips on a bus charter twice a year, and church bingo every Wednesday. At sixteen I lucked into a summer job on the railroad, which was like being plucked from homeroom to ride with the Dalton Gang. My coworkers gnawed fist-sized plugs of Red Man, worked like demons, and cussed like Baptists, apologetically but expertly. I hauled the cutting torch and handed out tools. Fire, iron, cussing I was hooked. Men worked. Real men worked hard. I ached to be one of them. I would grow up fast and never look back and wonder, What if? That fall I pushed carts of wool between the pattern cutters and the sewing line in a knitting mill, talking foolish to Puerto Rican girls with long names and short tempers. In the summer I painted houses. When other kids were boning up for the SATs, I was dipping steel after school on the paint line of a scaffolding factory. Word got around that I read books and that I might want to go to college. My shop nickname went from \"the Kid\" to \"Shakespeare.\" One foreman used to bring people down into the goop pit to look at the college boy. I called in sick the night of my senior prom. The next day I fished my class ring out of my jeans and showed it around. It had been sized the previous fall, before my hands were callused, swollen. I couldn't slide the ring on my finger. I don't recall the details, but I remember the phone call. A beverage distributor. Warehouse work. At night. Yes, I said, I can do that. When I shook Derek's hand, there were calluses. I knew I could be happy here. Mine is an exact science. Military strategy can be revised mid-conflict; stock portfolios might exceed expectations or underperform; even the best sawbones will advise you to get a second opinion. Economics, medicine, war with soda you've got to be precise. I'm here to verify the accuracy of the pick. Then I check the load sequence. We load backward to the delivery route, so that the first pallet in the nose of the trailer corresponds with the driver's last stop, and the last build is waiting on the tail when he throws open the door at his first. Fail to correct a mispick and you get written up. Let a misload slide by and you get written up. Forget to record an out-of-stock and, well, I'll let you guess. Get written up enough and bad things will happen. I labor under a hanging sword. The first night, Derek met me at the gate, showed me around, walked me through the drill. I plunged in. It had been months since I'd lifted anything heavier than objection. Longer since I'd pounded over a concrete floor. My knees felt like someone had driven steel spikes through them. My back ached. My feet. And this was only a four-hour getting-to-know-you shift. How did it go? Derek asked as I punched out. It went well, I said. It did not go well. I'd made a lot of mistakes. To my novice eye a twenty-pack of diet cola looked a lot like a twenty-four-pack. Orange and strawberry and mixed-fruit punches all displayed the same reddish glow by flashlight. Every screwup was faithfully recorded and relayed to me the next night in Derek's office, with a long face and a short talk that began, \"You messed up again.\" Another night I caught Derek watching me work. He had the disappointed look of a man whose new puppy has just chewed up his divan. Some names have been changed for privacy. Andrew Spear I can put a pretty face on every job I ever lost. Carol, through those high school gigs, a college-bound blond whose only flaw was that she didn't realize she was too good for me. Then Tricia the closest I've ever come to finding a soul mate, who'd be waiting when the mill whistle blew. Darla, with high Slavic cheekbones, who sold perfume in a department store while I worked the receiving dock. Terry, who sang in a jazz band. Another Carol in there somewhere. Maybe it was a Carla. Strivers all. They'd make their money waitressing or tending bar while taking classes at the junior college. Tricia used her personal-assistant position at a bank to learn her boss's job. Terry could tear up the Ella Fitzgerald songbook at night and study for her real estate license all day. I don't know what they saw in me. I'm no looker I have photo ID to back that up. Maybe they considered me a project a sad kitchen that had makeover potential, an old sofa that could be reupholstered, one threadbare patch at a time. We'd last six months or a year, depending on how long it took the wonder of me to wear off and be replaced with talk of plans, and goals, and us. And it would end, always the same way. They'd come home with flushed cheeks, all aglow about so-and-so's boyfriend who was making a killing in the mortgage business. Or a bank. Or fiber optic/broadband/soft serve. Or whatever sure thing was about to come up on the roulette wheel. But babe, I'd say, I have a job. And in the silence that followed I could hear the rumble of the U-Haul backing up. Another spring-popped sofa was headed to the tree lawn. We have to talk, they'd say. Later, I'd answer, pulling on my coat: I have to go to work. My father lived by a different code: If at first you don't succeed, screw it. My old man was always starting a new job or leaving one. I can recall him laying floor tile, driving a delivery van, installing car windshields, and stamping out wax milk cartons at a dairy and those were just my grammar-school years. It didn't take much a slight from his boss, real or imagined, or the prospect of a better gig, another pretty bubble floating past over a quitting-time beer. Whatever: He'd be off, ready to sell our cow for magic beans. I think his work ID must have shown the back of his head, going out a door. I can't explain his motivation. If I was the forgiving type, I'd say he was just looking for himself. But I don't forgive. One of my earliest memories is him sitting at our kitchen table, explaining how he'd just put in his two-weeks notice somewhere. I can still see the hollow look in my mother's eyes as she listened, with my kid brother in diapers, playing at her feet. I know how much hurt a man can inflict on a woman when his latest scheme crashes and the paychecks stop for months. Me, I took a different path. I guess I stayed too long at a half dozen parties. Guys who have half as many horses shot out from under them usually get a statue in the park. Looking back, I think I figured I could outlast anything. No excuses. Besides, \"looking back\" what does that get you? Places I worked, you could walk into something. I work and I sleep. Home is three rented rooms above a plumbing company. I lucked out for a month's security deposit and a workingman's wages I gather my mail on the cusp of suburbia. I kick off the sheets about 10:00 A.M. and sit with a cup of coffee, watching the paramedics' ambulances roll below my kitchen window. Down the block there's a fire station. Across the street there's a church and, next to that, a funeral home. I didn't plan it, but I figure I've got the bases covered when the time comes. At noon I run errands. I've taken a beginner's stab at cooking: I can assemble a scratch Bolognese sauce, whip up a serviceable cacciatore, do spaghetti alla anybody. Some days I'll walk up to the library and check out Giada De Laurentiis but only for the recipes. On a warm day, I push on to the supermarket, to sniff onions and gather carrots for a ragout. That's the real joy of cooking: You can eat your mistakes. I flip on the radio and prepare dinner for two, just me and Lucinda Williams. \"You're hiding out.\" I hear that a lot. That's how it must look to day-trippers: that night shifts are manned by Lost Boys who simply can't deal. I'll admit that perpetual dark requires a special breed. The world does shrink to a more manageable size in the wee hours traffic thins on the drive home, and you can park right by the door of the twenty-four-hour Walmart. But life never goes away entirely. You tote a lot more to work in a lunch pail than Ring Dings. You pack alimony and autism diagnoses and car notes and the rest of the workingman's grind. Baby needs a new pair of shoes. Also braces, a better school, and a down payment on that spring field trip. And you chew whatever has been dumped on your plate in silence. You don't go into therapy. You go to work. I get good at this job. Good enough at least. One night I look over a pallet and the case count just doesn't feel right. And it's not. I can distinguish between punches the berry mist glows a deep ocean blue by flashlight while the mixed berry appears almost cerulean. I can distinguish diet from classic by the color of the bottle caps at forty paces. I'm too sensible to claim expertise; let's just say I pull my weight. And I can't help but feel proud. I would have never made it this far if not for the kindness of strangers. When my screwups were a nightly lock and the day drivers were asking, Who was checking these loads, Stevie Wonder? Rick took me aside and said, \"Forget them guys. You work with us.\" Tommy pauses the forklift before loading, letting me get a better look. I learn later that Derek took some bullets from his bosses that were intended for me. When I'm gone and the next guy hoists the clipboard, they'll be just as kind to him. It's not about me; not everything is. Last summer I saw my first shooting star, and I'm a grown man. You live in the city, you don't spend much time looking up, I guess. This past winter Jerry was pulling trailers around when he came in and said, \"Look what the moon is doing.\" We watched that lunar eclipse. A few of the guys ran and got their cell phones and took pictures before Derek chased us back inside. \"You never seen a lunar eclipse before?\" he said. One morning we were standing in the parking lot, listening to Rick describe how good that first tall boy was going to taste when a whitetail buck sauntered up the street. Not a skittish Bambi I see those most nights on the drive home but a stud, a honking twelve-pointer. He wasn't lost. And he didn't hurry. He just posed under a streetlight, sniffed the breeze, and walked on. At least he knew where he was headed. Stand inside the semitrailer as the temperature drops and the metal groans like the rigging of a sailing ship. Once a month I update my rsum. Why, I don't know exactly. When I was looking, five months spent on orange plastic interview chairs, with my livelihood hanging on reliable transportation and a willingness to pee in a stranger's cup, that was the mantra. \"Make sure you keep your rsum updated,\" some hiring clerk would tell me. So I walk the hall of mirrors. There I am at the beginning my hair is black and my back is straight, and I'm sliding into my first Ford, heading off to work. \"Honky Tonk Women\" is on the radio. Then I'm gone, pushing, pulling my way down a tunnel. A page later you look up and that gray-haired daddy o' mine is ... you. That's the working life. No illusions: The only way I will ever see Paris is on the Travel Channel. I will never taste cassoulet unless they put it on the menu at Sheetz. I'm okay with that. One day you stare into the bathroom mirror and Willie Nelson is staring back at you. I'm okay with that, too. No regrets. You make choices, and every one feels right at the time. Because they are. There's work in poetry, and poetry in all work. I believe that. There is rhythm and meter in the slap of work boots on concrete. Your reward is more than a paycheck. It is a connection to something larger, even if the something larger is a half dozen men in a barbed-wire yard. It might not look like that to the untrained eye, just passing our open dock door large men pulling and moving, pulling and moving, in artificial light. I understand. Sometimes it's hard to tell the picture from the frame. You want something higher, a prickly Everyman speaking half-truths to power, go scare up Joe the Plumber. All I know is this: I am a schlub walking a high wire between paydays in steel-toed shoes. And my name is legion. We're polar bears on an ice floe. Our habitat is disappearing. This little world can end a thousand ways. Quickly, with a slipped disk or a herniated anything, and you'll spend your days on disability, giving depositions to lawyers who advertise on the back of the Yellow Pages. It could be snatched away by cold metal hands right now somebody is thinking up a way to get robots to do this job. It would work, probably. But I don't think the soda would taste as sweet, you know? But not tonight. I pull into the lot at sundown. Beyond the chain-link the yard is lit by floodlights. I wait as the printer spits out my load diagrams. Joe sidles over and tells a joke whose punchline is, \"Hey, Father, it's me, Sister Bridget!\" We agree after a brief consultation that Grady Sizemore would make a great porn name. I take a deep breath and head out. \"Hey, John, where you going with that clipboard in your hand?\" Rob calls as I pass. \"Johnny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are callin' ye ...\" Jerry croons. Tommy drives up. \"Man, I just don't know ...\" he grins, and I know it's going to be a bumpy night. \"Three in the yard, two in the dock,\" Derek says. I nod. Outside, tow motors are streaking around like clown cars. Big Rick stops and leans down from the cab. \"I got one for you. How many yards did Rex Kern throw for his senior year?

        "url_text": "Andrew Spear This is my life: I work the graveyard shift for a beverage distributor outside Cleveland, Ohio. Thirty hours a week I'm making the world safe for carbonated refreshment. Or at least three counties of it. Job, life same difference. Basically, I'm a yard monkey, climbing around inside semitrailers in the dark with a flashlight, checking pallet tickets against the product loaded, matching invoices. When I'm satisfied everything's jake, I toss in a dock plate, set the load lock, and seal 'em up. Then I log everything truck, load, and seal numbers for the dispatcher and hop up into the next trailer. And the next. And the next. No job's perfect, this one especially. I'm fifty-nine. The first two hours of my shift are spent outside. You work outdoors in a Great Lakes winter and you know cold mind-fogging, finger-stiffening cold. In the summer you head off to work just as the sidewalk cafs and patio bars are filling up, driving past laughing guys and girls with bare shoulders studying the appetizer menu. I don't know which season is worse. That may sound fairly grim, careerwise: the last splash of a clumsy diver. I have done other things. For better money. In the sunshine. But long before those jobs withered and they did, as all things planted in the Rust Belt inevitably do I had a hunch I'd end up on the dark side. Actually, I knew. I lost a loading job in the winter of 2008. The contemporary job-search experience can best be summed up by the phrase \"part-time man.\" I saw that scrawled on an index card thumbtacked to a job board: \"Seeking Part-time Man.\" First thing, you take a number and get in line with the rest of the unemployed. Then you look at the number in your hand 14,000,000. To move up the line, you have to reinvent yourself. Kind of like a pitcher who's losing his fastball. You find a new pitch. Mine was this: No job's too hard. And you move up the line a little. Decide that the only answer to every question is \"Yes, sir\" and you move up a little more. Working nights was a practical decision; jobs are easier to come by if you'll take a shift most people wouldn't touch. Still, it took five months to find this gig. You sleep the daylight away, but there are perks. Being productive, making your own way in a little world, being heard in the larger one there's enough slack talk around about the rewards of sweat labor to fill a sociol-ogy textbook. A lot of it is charming nonsense; a nugget or two may even be true. Here's what I know: Every man needs an arena, and this is mine. I pull into the lot at sundown. The guys are stripping trailers. From the street they look like a pirate crew sacking a merchant fleet. There's Mr. Tommy, the motor driver, eighteen years under this Big Top, who's forgotten more about the soda-pop business than the board of directors will ever know. Jerry has a saltwater aquarium at home and is raising a shark. Joe owns maybe one piece of apparel that doesn't sport a Chief Wahoo. He has the same sense of humor as me dry and twisted which helps if you're a Tribe fan. Big Rick favors a biker's bandanna and looks like Monsieur Zig-Zag on growth hormones. He's the king of sports trivia; ask him what number Archie Griffin wore and he'll say, \"Ohio State or the pros?\" Then there's Rob, my buddy Rob. Rob trails dreadlocks, speaks fluent Bob Marley, and always surprises. He's a cabbage wizard, and if there's a rarer bird than a Rastafarian who cooks Bavarian, I haven't found one. Dario and Danny are the newbies. I don't know much about them. I don't have to. Derek the night manager is a Steelers fan and has a little shrine to Franco Harris in his office. Here in Browns Town it's the subject of scorn and the object of the occasional black ops. Derek doesn't say much. He's the boss. He doesn't have to. This is my stage: Cinder-block walls and a concrete floor under a corrugated roof maybe forty feet overhead. Wooden pallets of product are stacked nearly to the ceiling six-packs, twelve-packs, twenty-four-packs, thirty-twos. Two-liter bottles rest in trays of eight, twenty-ounce bottles wait in plastic shells. There is juice squeezed from every fruit you can imagine and a few I think someone's made up. A sea of soda. The builders chug down the aisles, dragging pallet jacks, studying the pull tickets in their free hands. A dozen diet-cola twelve-packs check. Root beer. Teas diet, lemon, sweetened, and not. They stack and move on. The job is no different from a supermarket run to get a sense, try pulling a couple of two-liter bottles off a store shelf and tossing them into your shopping cart. Repeat that two thousand times in an eight-hour shift and you've got an idea of the work. Tommy rolls past. He's been outside loading. The cab of his forklift is covered by a plastic tarp. Thunder booms. He shouts a greeting that marks him as a lifelong Clevelander: \"At least it's not snowing.\" I pull up the hood of my sweatshirt and splash out into the yard. Rain is falling in sheets. Christ. On the shop radio Supertramp is advising I take the long way home. The bull waits, pawing the ground. The matador strides to the center of the ring. The bull lifts its head and says, \"So tell me a little about yourself.\" I hated job interviews: clammy handshakes followed by the moment of truth. Well, I'd say, there's little to tell. I was born to sweat. I grew up in a blue-collar Cleveland neighborhood, a little bit of Old Europe transplanted onto a bend of the Cuyahoga River. The men Poles, Slovaks, Czechs, Ukies, Hungarians were scrappers and needed to be. Their wives stayed home, had gardens and babies, and could see the future in the bottoms of teacups. I never needed a fortune-teller to see mine. It came shuffling past our porch every evening at 5:25, toting a lunch pail. At eighteen you were swallowed by the python and made your way through the beast like a lump. At the other end was a mill pension, casino trips on a bus charter twice a year, and church bingo every Wednesday. At sixteen I lucked into a summer job on the railroad, which was like being plucked from homeroom to ride with the Dalton Gang. My coworkers gnawed fist-sized plugs of Red Man, worked like demons, and cussed like Baptists, apologetically but expertly. I hauled the cutting torch and handed out tools. Fire, iron, cussing I was hooked. Men worked. Real men worked hard. I ached to be one of them. I would grow up fast and never look back and wonder, What if? That fall I pushed carts of wool between the pattern cutters and the sewing line in a knitting mill, talking foolish to Puerto Rican girls with long names and short tempers. In the summer I painted houses. When other kids were boning up for the SATs, I was dipping steel after school on the paint line of a scaffolding factory. Word got around that I read books and that I might want to go to college. My shop nickname went from \"the Kid\" to \"Shakespeare.\" One foreman used to bring people down into the goop pit to look at the college boy. I called in sick the night of my senior prom. The next day I fished my class ring out of my jeans and showed it around. It had been sized the previous fall, before my hands were callused, swollen. I couldn't slide the ring on my finger. I don't recall the details, but I remember the phone call. A beverage distributor. Warehouse work. At night. Yes, I said, I can do that. When I shook Derek's hand, there were calluses. I knew I could be happy here. Mine is an exact science. Military strategy can be revised mid-conflict; stock portfolios might exceed expectations or underperform; even the best sawbones will advise you to get a second opinion. Economics, medicine, war with soda you've got to be precise. I'm here to verify the accuracy of the pick. Then I check the load sequence. We load backward to the delivery route, so that the first pallet in the nose of the trailer corresponds with the driver's last stop, and the last build is waiting on the tail when he throws open the door at his first. Fail to correct a mispick and you get written up. Let a misload slide by and you get written up. Forget to record an out-of-stock and, well, I'll let you guess. Get written up enough and bad things will happen. I labor under a hanging sword. The first night, Derek met me at the gate, showed me around, walked me through the drill. I plunged in. It had been months since I'd lifted anything heavier than objection. Longer since I'd pounded over a concrete floor. My knees felt like someone had driven steel spikes through them. My back ached. My feet. And this was only a four-hour getting-to-know-you shift. How did it go? Derek asked as I punched out. It went well, I said. It did not go well. I'd made a lot of mistakes. To my novice eye a twenty-pack of diet cola looked a lot like a twenty-four-pack. Orange and strawberry and mixed-fruit punches all displayed the same reddish glow by flashlight. Every screwup was faithfully recorded and relayed to me the next night in Derek's office, with a long face and a short talk that began, \"You messed up again.\" Another night I caught Derek watching me work. He had the disappointed look of a man whose new puppy has just chewed up his divan. Some names have been changed for privacy. Andrew Spear I can put a pretty face on every job I ever lost. Carol, through those high school gigs, a college-bound blond whose only flaw was that she didn't realize she was too good for me. Then Tricia the closest I've ever come to finding a soul mate, who'd be waiting when the mill whistle blew. Darla, with high Slavic cheekbones, who sold perfume in a department store while I worked the receiving dock. Terry, who sang in a jazz band. Another Carol in there somewhere. Maybe it was a Carla. Strivers all. They'd make their money waitressing or tending bar while taking classes at the junior college. Tricia used her personal-assistant position at a bank to learn her boss's job. Terry could tear up the Ella Fitzgerald songbook at night and study for her real estate license all day. I don't know what they saw in me. I'm no looker I have photo ID to back that up. Maybe they considered me a project a sad kitchen that had makeover potential, an old sofa that could be reupholstered, one threadbare patch at a time. We'd last six months or a year, depending on how long it took the wonder of me to wear off and be replaced with talk of plans, and goals, and us. And it would end, always the same way. They'd come home with flushed cheeks, all aglow about so-and-so's boyfriend who was making a killing in the mortgage business. Or a bank. Or fiber optic/broadband/soft serve. Or whatever sure thing was about to come up on the roulette wheel. But babe, I'd say, I have a job. And in the silence that followed I could hear the rumble of the U-Haul backing up. Another spring-popped sofa was headed to the tree lawn. We have to talk, they'd say. Later, I'd answer, pulling on my coat: I have to go to work. My father lived by a different code: If at first you don't succeed, screw it. My old man was always starting a new job or leaving one. I can recall him laying floor tile, driving a delivery van, installing car windshields, and stamping out wax milk cartons at a dairy and those were just my grammar-school years. It didn't take much a slight from his boss, real or imagined, or the prospect of a better gig, another pretty bubble floating past over a quitting-time beer. Whatever: He'd be off, ready to sell our cow for magic beans. I think his work ID must have shown the back of his head, going out a door. I can't explain his motivation. If I was the forgiving type, I'd say he was just looking for himself. But I don't forgive. One of my earliest memories is him sitting at our kitchen table, explaining how he'd just put in his two-weeks notice somewhere. I can still see the hollow look in my mother's eyes as she listened, with my kid brother in diapers, playing at her feet. I know how much hurt a man can inflict on a woman when his latest scheme crashes and the paychecks stop for months. Me, I took a different path. I guess I stayed too long at a half dozen parties. Guys who have half as many horses shot out from under them usually get a statue in the park. Looking back, I think I figured I could outlast anything. No excuses. Besides, \"looking back\" what does that get you? Places I worked, you could walk into something. I work and I sleep. Home is three rented rooms above a plumbing company. I lucked out for a month's security deposit and a workingman's wages I gather my mail on the cusp of suburbia. I kick off the sheets about 10:00 A.M. and sit with a cup of coffee, watching the paramedics' ambulances roll below my kitchen window. Down the block there's a fire station. Across the street there's a church and, next to that, a funeral home. I didn't plan it, but I figure I've got the bases covered when the time comes. At noon I run errands. I've taken a beginner's stab at cooking: I can assemble a scratch Bolognese sauce, whip up a serviceable cacciatore, do spaghetti alla anybody. Some days I'll walk up to the library and check out Giada De Laurentiis but only for the recipes. On a warm day, I push on to the supermarket, to sniff onions and gather carrots for a ragout. That's the real joy of cooking: You can eat your mistakes. I flip on the radio and prepare dinner for two, just me and Lucinda Williams. \"You're hiding out.\" I hear that a lot. That's how it must look to day-trippers: that night shifts are manned by Lost Boys who simply can't deal. I'll admit that perpetual dark requires a special breed. The world does shrink to a more manageable size in the wee hours traffic thins on the drive home, and you can park right by the door of the twenty-four-hour Walmart. But life never goes away entirely. You tote a lot more to work in a lunch pail than Ring Dings. You pack alimony and autism diagnoses and car notes and the rest of the workingman's grind. Baby needs a new pair of shoes. Also braces, a better school, and a down payment on that spring field trip. And you chew whatever has been dumped on your plate in silence. You don't go into therapy. You go to work. I get good at this job. Good enough at least. One night I look over a pallet and the case count just doesn't feel right. And it's not. I can distinguish between punches the berry mist glows a deep ocean blue by flashlight while the mixed berry appears almost cerulean. I can distinguish diet from classic by the color of the bottle caps at forty paces. I'm too sensible to claim expertise; let's just say I pull my weight. And I can't help but feel proud. I would have never made it this far if not for the kindness of strangers. When my screwups were a nightly lock and the day drivers were asking, Who was checking these loads, Stevie Wonder? Rick took me aside and said, \"Forget them guys. You work with us.\" Tommy pauses the forklift before loading, letting me get a better look. I learn later that Derek took some bullets from his bosses that were intended for me. When I'm gone and the next guy hoists the clipboard, they'll be just as kind to him. It's not about me; not everything is. Last summer I saw my first shooting star, and I'm a grown man. You live in the city, you don't spend much time looking up, I guess. This past winter Jerry was pulling trailers around when he came in and said, \"Look what the moon is doing.\" We watched that lunar eclipse. A few of the guys ran and got their cell phones and took pictures before Derek chased us back inside. \"You never seen a lunar eclipse before?\" he said. One morning we were standing in the parking lot, listening to Rick describe how good that first tall boy was going to taste when a whitetail buck sauntered up the street. Not a skittish Bambi I see those most nights on the drive home but a stud, a honking twelve-pointer. He wasn't lost. And he didn't hurry. He just posed under a streetlight, sniffed the breeze, and walked on. At least he knew where he was headed. Stand inside the semitrailer as the temperature drops and the metal groans like the rigging of a sailing ship. Once a month I update my rsum. Why, I don't know exactly. When I was looking, five months spent on orange plastic interview chairs, with my livelihood hanging on reliable transportation and a willingness to pee in a stranger's cup, that was the mantra. \"Make sure you keep your rsum updated,\" some hiring clerk would tell me. So I walk the hall of mirrors. There I am at the beginning my hair is black and my back is straight, and I'm sliding into my first Ford, heading off to work. \"Honky Tonk Women\" is on the radio. Then I'm gone, pushing, pulling my way down a tunnel. A page later you look up and that gray-haired daddy o' mine is ... you. That's the working life. No illusions: The only way I will ever see Paris is on the Travel Channel. I will never taste cassoulet unless they put it on the menu at Sheetz. I'm okay with that. One day you stare into the bathroom mirror and Willie Nelson is staring back at you. I'm okay with that, too. No regrets. You make choices, and every one feels right at the time. Because they are. There's work in poetry, and poetry in all work. I believe that. There is rhythm and meter in the slap of work boots on concrete. Your reward is more than a paycheck. It is a connection to something larger, even if the something larger is a half dozen men in a barbed-wire yard. It might not look like that to the untrained eye, just passing our open dock door large men pulling and moving, pulling and moving, in artificial light. I understand. Sometimes it's hard to tell the picture from the frame. You want something higher, a prickly Everyman speaking half-truths to power, go scare up Joe the Plumber. All I know is this: I am a schlub walking a high wire between paydays in steel-toed shoes. And my name is legion. We're polar bears on an ice floe. Our habitat is disappearing. This little world can end a thousand ways. Quickly, with a slipped disk or a herniated anything, and you'll spend your days on disability, giving depositions to lawyers who advertise on the back of the Yellow Pages. It could be snatched away by cold metal hands right now somebody is thinking up a way to get robots to do this job. It would work, probably. But I don't think the soda would taste as sweet, you know? But not tonight. I pull into the lot at sundown. Beyond the chain-link the yard is lit by floodlights. I wait as the printer spits out my load diagrams. Joe sidles over and tells a joke whose punchline is, \"Hey, Father, it's me, Sister Bridget!\" We agree after a brief consultation that Grady Sizemore would make a great porn name. I take a deep breath and head out. \"Hey, John, where you going with that clipboard in your hand?\" Rob calls as I pass. \"Johnny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are callin' ye ...\" Jerry croons. Tommy drives up. \"Man, I just don't know ...\" he grins, and I know it's going to be a bumpy night. \"Three in the yard, two in the dock,\" Derek says. I nod. Outside, tow motors are streaking around like clown cars. Big Rick stops and leans down from the cab. \"I got one for you. How many yards did Rex Kern throw for his senior year? I'll give you a minute.\" And then he roars off. \"Let us not talk falsely now,\" Jimi advises from the shop radio. \"The hour's getting late.\" Inside I can hear the guys ragging on one another, roaring like happy bears. Together we will tug, until night becomes day. We've got barbed wire and high fences to keep whatever evil is out there, walking, away. Men are working here. John Hyduk is a lifelong Clevelander.

          "We thought economic growth and technology would liberate China. Instead, it corrupted us.Oct. 9, 2019Credit...Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThe Peoples Republic of China is the largest, most powerful and arguably most brutal totalitarian state in the world. It denies basic human rights to all of its nearly 1.4 billion citizens. There is no freedom of speech, thought, assembly, religion, movement or any semblance of political liberty in China. Under Xi Jinping, president for life, the Communist Party of China has built the most technologically sophisticated repression machine the world has ever seen. In Xinjiang, in Western China, the government is using technology to mount a cultural genocide against the Muslim Uighur minority that is even more total than the one it carried out in Tibet. Human rights experts say that more than a million people are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, two million more are in forced re-education, and everyone else is invasively surveilled via ubiquitous cameras, artificial intelligence and other high-tech means.None of this is a secret. Under Xi, China has grown markedly more Orwellian; not only is it stamping its heel more firmly on its own citizens, but it is also exporting its digital shackles to authoritarians the world over. Yet unlike the way we once talked about pariah nations say East Germany or North Korea or apartheid South Africa American and European lawmakers, Western media and the worlds largest corporations rarely treat China as what it plainly is: a growing and existential threat to human freedom across the world.Why do we give China a pass? In a word: capitalism. Because for 40 years, the Wests relationship with China has been governed by a strategic error the dimensions of which are only now coming into horrific view.[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]A parade of American presidents on the left and the right argued that by cultivating China as a market hastening its economic growth and technological sophistication while bringing our own companies a billion new workers and customers we would inevitably loosen the regimes hold on its people. Even Donald Trump, who made bashing China a theme of his campaign, sees the country mainly through the lens of markets. Hell eagerly prosecute a pointless trade war against China, but when it comes to the millions in Hong Kong who are protesting Chinas creeping despotism over their territory, Trump prefers to stay mum.Well, funny thing: It turns out the Wests entire political theory about China has been spectacularly wrong. China has engineered ferocious economic growth in the past half century, lifting hundreds of millions of its citizens out of miserable poverty. But Chinas growth did not come at any cost to the regimes political chokehold.A darker truth is now dawning on the world: Chinas economic miracle hasnt just failed to liberate Chinese people. It is also now routinely corrupting the rest of us outside of China.This was the theme of the N.B.A.s hasty and embarrassing apology this week after Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager, tweeted and quickly deleted a message in support of Hong Kongs protesters. After an outcry from American lawmakers, Adam Silver, the N.B.A.s commissioner, later seemed to backtrack on his genuflection.But I wasnt comforted. The N.B.A. is far from the first American institution to accede to Chinas limits on liberty. Hollywood, large tech companies and a variety of consumer brands from Delta to Zara have been more than willing to play ball. The submission is spreading: This week the American video game company Blizzard suspended a player for calling for the liberation of Hong Kong in a live-stream. And according to Deadspin, ESPN a network owned by Disney, which has worked closely with the Chinese government on some big deals in China warned anchors against discussing Chinese politics in talking about the Rockets controversy.This sort of corporate capitulation is hardly surprising. For Western companies, China is simply too big and too rich a market to ignore, let alone to pressure or to police. If the first and most important cost of doing business in China is the surgical extraction of a C.E.O.s spine, many businesses are only too happy to provide the stretcher and the scalpel.But it will only get worse from here, and we are fools to play this game. There is a school of thought that says America should not think of China as an enemy. With its far larger population, Chinas economy will inevitably come to eclipse ours, but that is hardly a mortal threat. In climate change, the world faces a huge collective-action problem that will require global cooperation. According to this view, treating China like an adversary will only frustrate our own long-term goals.But this perspective leaves out the threat that greater economic and technological integration with China poses to everyone outside of China. It ignores the ever-steeper capitulation that China requires of its partners. And it overlooks the most important new factor in the Chinese regimes longevity: the seductive efficiency that technology offers to effect a breathtaking new level of control over its population.There was a time when Westerners believed that the internet would be the Communist regimes ruin. In a speech in 2000 urging Congress to normalize trade relations with China, President Bill Clinton famously quipped: Theres no question China has been trying to crack down on the internet. Good luck! Thats sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. The crowd of foreign policy experts erupted in knowing laughter.China proved them wrong. It didnt just find a way to nail Jell-O; it became a Jell-O master carpenter. Through online surveillance, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and the propagandistic gold mine of social media, China has mobilized a set of tools that allow it to invisibly, routinely repress its citizens and shape political opinion by manipulating their feelings and grievances on just about any controversy.This set of skills horrifies me. China may not be exporting its political ideology, but through lavish spending and trade, it is expanding its influence across the planet. There is a risk that Chinas success becomes a kind of template for the world. In the coming decades, instead of democracy which you may have noticed is not having such a hot run on either side of the Atlantic Chinese-style tech-abetted surveillance authoritarianism could become a template for how much of the world works.I should say there were a couple of small reasons for optimism regarding the spread of Chinese tyranny. The bipartisan outrage over the N.B.A.s initial apology to China did suggest American lawmakers arent willing to give China a completely free pass. The Trump administration also did something clever, placing eight Chinese surveillance technology companies and several police departments on a blacklist forbidding them from trading with American companies.But if we are to have any hope of countering Chinas dictatorial apparatus, well need a smarter and more sustained effort from our leaders.

          "One of the surprising things to me is how much China seems to have played their hand too early (and too strongly). People have been sounding alarms about China for a while but if they had played it cool everything likely would’ve ticked along as it was. Everyone would still ignore the human rights abuses, and IP theft, and creeping influence in our institutions around the world, etc. Instead China has managed to really put it right in front of every average persons face and now there’s a real chance things could shift away from China. And what for? Ego? On the one hand I think the CCP bought a dud with Chairman Xi. But maybe that’s good for the rest of us.",
          "In this light of recent heat up of issues with China, I want to share a positive story to contrast: I had a daily driver in Chengdu for over 1 month who spoke no English, zero, none at all - not even \"yes\" or \"no\". We communicated via Google translate (on VPN). He would play Chinese music and then some days I would play some American rock and roll. We bonded in inexplicable ways.

          "One of the surprising things to me is how much China seems to have played their hand too early (and too strongly). People have been sounding alarms about China for a while but if they had played it cool everything likely would’ve ticked along as it was. Everyone would still ignore the human rights abuses, and IP theft, and creeping influence in our institutions around the world, etc. Instead China has managed to really put it right in front of every average persons face and now there’s a real chance things could shift away from China. And what for? Ego? On the one hand I think the CCP bought a dud with Chairman Xi. But maybe that’s good for the rest of us.",
          "In this light of recent heat up of issues with China, I want to share a positive story to contrast: I had a daily driver in Chengdu for over 1 month who spoke no English, zero, none at all - not even \"yes\" or \"no\". We communicated via Google translate (on VPN). He would play Chinese music and then some days I would play some American rock and roll. We bonded in inexplicable ways.

        "url_text": "We thought economic growth and technology would liberate China. Instead, it corrupted us.Oct. 9, 2019Credit...Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThe Peoples Republic of China is the largest, most powerful and arguably most brutal totalitarian state in the world. It denies basic human rights to all of its nearly 1.4 billion citizens. There is no freedom of speech, thought, assembly, religion, movement or any semblance of political liberty in China. Under Xi Jinping, president for life, the Communist Party of China has built the most technologically sophisticated repression machine the world has ever seen. In Xinjiang, in Western China, the government is using technology to mount a cultural genocide against the Muslim Uighur minority that is even more total than the one it carried out in Tibet. Human rights experts say that more than a million people are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, two million more are in forced re-education, and everyone else is invasively surveilled via ubiquitous cameras, artificial intelligence and other high-tech means.None of this is a secret. Under Xi, China has grown markedly more Orwellian; not only is it stamping its heel more firmly on its own citizens, but it is also exporting its digital shackles to authoritarians the world over. Yet unlike the way we once talked about pariah nations say East Germany or North Korea or apartheid South Africa American and European lawmakers, Western media and the worlds largest corporations rarely treat China as what it plainly is: a growing and existential threat to human freedom across the world.Why do we give China a pass? In a word: capitalism. Because for 40 years, the Wests relationship with China has been governed by a strategic error the dimensions of which are only now coming into horrific view.[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]A parade of American presidents on the left and the right argued that by cultivating China as a market hastening its economic growth and technological sophistication while bringing our own companies a billion new workers and customers we would inevitably loosen the regimes hold on its people. Even Donald Trump, who made bashing China a theme of his campaign, sees the country mainly through the lens of markets. Hell eagerly prosecute a pointless trade war against China, but when it comes to the millions in Hong Kong who are protesting Chinas creeping despotism over their territory, Trump prefers to stay mum.Well, funny thing: It turns out the Wests entire political theory about China has been spectacularly wrong. China has engineered ferocious economic growth in the past half century, lifting hundreds of millions of its citizens out of miserable poverty. But Chinas growth did not come at any cost to the regimes political chokehold.A darker truth is now dawning on the world: Chinas economic miracle hasnt just failed to liberate Chinese people. It is also now routinely corrupting the rest of us outside of China.This was the theme of the N.B.A.s hasty and embarrassing apology this week after Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager, tweeted and quickly deleted a message in support of Hong Kongs protesters. After an outcry from American lawmakers, Adam Silver, the N.B.A.s commissioner, later seemed to backtrack on his genuflection.But I wasnt comforted. The N.B.A. is far from the first American institution to accede to Chinas limits on liberty. Hollywood, large tech companies and a variety of consumer brands from Delta to Zara have been more than willing to play ball. The submission is spreading: This week the American video game company Blizzard suspended a player for calling for the liberation of Hong Kong in a live-stream. And according to Deadspin, ESPN a network owned by Disney, which has worked closely with the Chinese government on some big deals in China warned anchors against discussing Chinese politics in talking about the Rockets controversy.This sort of corporate capitulation is hardly surprising. For Western companies, China is simply too big and too rich a market to ignore, let alone to pressure or to police. If the first and most important cost of doing business in China is the surgical extraction of a C.E.O.s spine, many businesses are only too happy to provide the stretcher and the scalpel.But it will only get worse from here, and we are fools to play this game. There is a school of thought that says America should not think of China as an enemy. With its far larger population, Chinas economy will inevitably come to eclipse ours, but that is hardly a mortal threat. In climate change, the world faces a huge collective-action problem that will require global cooperation. According to this view, treating China like an adversary will only frustrate our own long-term goals.But this perspective leaves out the threat that greater economic and technological integration with China poses to everyone outside of China. It ignores the ever-steeper capitulation that China requires of its partners. And it overlooks the most important new factor in the Chinese regimes longevity: the seductive efficiency that technology offers to effect a breathtaking new level of control over its population.There was a time when Westerners believed that the internet would be the Communist regimes ruin. In a speech in 2000 urging Congress to normalize trade relations with China, President Bill Clinton famously quipped: Theres no question China has been trying to crack down on the internet. Good luck! Thats sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. The crowd of foreign policy experts erupted in knowing laughter.China proved them wrong. It didnt just find a way to nail Jell-O; it became a Jell-O master carpenter. Through online surveillance, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and the propagandistic gold mine of social media, China has mobilized a set of tools that allow it to invisibly, routinely repress its citizens and shape political opinion by manipulating their feelings and grievances on just about any controversy.This set of skills horrifies me. China may not be exporting its political ideology, but through lavish spending and trade, it is expanding its influence across the planet. There is a risk that Chinas success becomes a kind of template for the world. In the coming decades, instead of democracy which you may have noticed is not having such a hot run on either side of the Atlantic Chinese-style tech-abetted surveillance authoritarianism could become a template for how much of the world works.I should say there were a couple of small reasons for optimism regarding the spread of Chinese tyranny. The bipartisan outrage over the N.B.A.s initial apology to China did suggest American lawmakers arent willing to give China a completely free pass. The Trump administration also did something clever, placing eight Chinese surveillance technology companies and several police departments on a blacklist forbidding them from trading with American companies.But if we are to have any hope of countering Chinas dictatorial apparatus, well need a smarter and more sustained effort from our leaders.

          "I want to start this by saying how much I like Jetbrains. Installing Resharper for the first time and discovering what it was capable of was one of the most exciting moments in my .NET career. I felt like I was getting super-powered overnight. I liked it so much that I begged my boss to buy it for everyone in the shop. He didnt say no, but his delay made me by it myself. I couldnt stand living without it. Later on he ended up buying 43 licenses, and after that, for whatever bizarre reason, my e-mail ended up being the main contact for Thomson Reuters and one day I received an e-mail asking me if I wanted to renew the 2000+ licenses registered on my name. Anyway. I kind of feel like they like me to :).After my experience with Resharper, my mindset was that whatever they produce should be of equivalent excellence so, when I first started learning Node.js and React back in early 2015, I didnt hesitate and bought myself a WebStorm license. It seemed to be fairly up to date with whatever nerdy-fashionable-gimmicky library or framework was trending at the time, and React was included, so I was happy. I compared it with Atom, which was one of the major choices at the time, but the seamless Git integration, the refactorings, the smart code completion and error highlightings kept me tied to WebStorm. Atom seemed too slow to add so little to the table (at least at the time).Then, a few months later, mid 2015, Visual Studio Code came along. I remember my first thought was:What the he*k is Microsoft thinking? I mean GitHub creates Electron, then Atom on top of it (Not necessarily in that order). The developer community seems to be more engaged to it than it would ever be to any Microsoft product. Because You know, Microsoft. And then Microsoft comes in and expects to use GitHubs own weapon to create another Atom? No way this will ever work.I didnt even bother to check whether I would switch from WebStorm. I wouldnt.Then, later 2015, Jetbrains announced the most controversial, rant-provoking license change that I have ever witnessed in the dev community. They would switch to a subscription based model. Reddit went on fire, lots of posts with repeating complaints and heated comments. Jetbrains even seemed to be reconsidering but they came back with a final decision that didnt change that much. I personally didnt think it was all that bad at the time. I mean, I would end up paying for it anyways. Maybe it would even help the company to create even greater products.Fast forward to mid 2016, Microsoft releases VS Code 1.0 and for the first time I started reading positive reviews about it all over Reddit, Hacker News and Twitter. People seemed to like what they were seeing. One of the top praise points was how fast new releases were coming out, and how the dev team seemed to be hearing the community and making their UserVoice the actual road-map.At that point I decided to install it and compare it with WebStorm. I thought: Not quite there yet, but promising.. I remember complaining about the absence of tabs and how fast it took for the tabs to actually be included. I felt like I couldnt quite replace Webstorm yet but I started to use VS Code casually. I liked the Git integration, the simplicity in the UI, how fast it was, and the fact that everything seemed to work kind of naturally. I mean, it wasnt as smart as WebStorm but the syntax highlights and code inference didnt break with modern JavaScript like React. TypeScript worked as a charm (no wonder) and CSS, Less and Sass seemed OK. Ah, and the fact that they released new versions like crazy (VS Code and Node.js should have won the 2016 release frenzy awards). Ah, and the fact that for the first time I got to debug Node.js just by hitting a button without having to pass through a satanic ritual or selling my soul the devil. Ah, and the fact that I installed the Python Extension and it went so seamless, with PyLint, debugging and code completion support, that I see reasons why people would favor VSC over PyCharm, even though PyCharm has a free version and is an awesome tool.As time went on, I started to pay more attention to the problems WebStorm always had and I previously overlooked. Probably because I now had an alternative and because the new subscription model was weighting, even if not that much. It was slow. Some bugs were never fixed (like the moving file refactoring bug that would screw up all the imports) and the refactorings seemed less important for me now for some reason (maybe I got more experienced?). The point is, I started to think whether I would renew the subscription or jump to VSC altogether. I didnt renew it, even though I still find WebStorm an awesome tool.Now lets analyze the VCS vs. Atom situation.I dont know why the h*ck GitHub thought it was a good idea to invest in a text-editor but Im glad they did (I still think they should have created Electron to be the basis of the best possible cross-platform Git GUI ever, not a text-editor, but this is material for another article). Anyway, I see a lot of value in Atom nevertheless.Microsoft, in the other hand, has a lot more motive. Nadelas objective is clearly the cloud and that is going quite well. They want to create the best possible cross-platform editor and make it popular so theyll be able, in the future, to use it as a leverage to push devs to Azure, no matter what technology theyre using. VSC doesnt seem like a leverage to today because they need more traction first, but it will when the time is right. By the way, I was wrong about my first reaction about VSC, both about the editor and about Microsoft. It seems that Nadela has changed the company so much.Here are the top 2 comments on a Reddit thread comparing Atom and VSC:I used Atom exclusively on mac for development (php, vue and some angular) for several months and loved it.I switched to VSC a few weeks ago because I loved VS when worked on a .NET stack. Honestly, its about the same in terms of functionality, I like that its a little more streamlined and I think it handles syntax highlighting better than Atom (in terms of laravel blade).Really, just download and try it out for a bit, download the extensions you need and go to town. There is very little difference between Brackets, Atom and VS Code.Source.Atom and VS Code are very similar in concept, but their execution is wildly different. (Although less so now that Code has added tabs to the editor window.) The biggest difference between the two is that Codes performance is orders of magnitude better than Atoms. For example, I used to keep a second editor (usually Sublime) ready for opening large files, because Atom just couldnt Fucking Do it. I no longer have Sublime installed because I didnt see a reason to put it on this machine after switching to VS Code for most of my editing.Source.Now back to Jetbrains.I expect most of Jetbrains revenue to come from IntelliJ based IDEs and Resharper. Oh wait, they have a 2015 annual report (2016 not available yet). I was almost right.If you take the time to look at the report youll see that 2015 was an awesome year for Jetbrains. But, theres always a but, Im not sure if the next 10 years will look as bright. BecauseAtom and VSC are getting strong, I personally think VC Code will win because Microsoft has a brazillian of money and they need it to support Azure in their fight against AWS. Both Atom and VS Code are starting as text-editors on steroids but I believe they will eventually evolve, specially VS Code, to the IntelliJ level in the long run. And it will all be facilitated by how easy it is to code extensions for these editors, especially because you can do it in JavaScript and everybody loves it. As it happened with Python already, I think these editors will become smart enough to minimize the need for IntelliJ IDEs in lots of languages..NET Core, in terms of coding, seems to be the priority for Microsoft now. I dont see the full-fledged Visual Studio losing any steam in the short term, but I think this will happen in the long run, in favor of VSC. Besides, with every new release of Visual Studio, theres a bit less need for Resharper. Microsoft might catch up. They might was well end up buying Jetbrains or the Resharper division as they did with Xamarin (not that Im rooting for it, competition is healthy).I want to wrap this up by stating that I wish the best for Jetbrains but I think theyll need to reshape to stay relevant in the next 10 years, if theyre not bought. I dont see any reason they why wouldnt (reshape). Theyre full of enthusiasm and ridiculously talented minds. Theyll find a way.Thanks Microsoft, Jetbrains and GitHub for making my coding career so enjoyable. ",

          "Tobias Boes, Thomas Manns War: Literature, Politics, and the World Republic of Letters (Ithaca, New York and London: Cornell University Press, 2019), 376 pp., $34.95. IN FEBRUARY 1938, Thomas Mann and his family sailed from Cherbourg, France to New York, where they were greeted by a throng of reporters and a film crew from the Paramount News Corporation. Mann, who had won the Nobel Prize in 1929 and appeared on the cover of Time in 1934, decried British prime minister Neville Chamberlains policy of appeasement and correctly predicted that Hitler would annex Austria forthwith. Later that day, Mann, after being asked whether he found exile a lonely state of affairs, responded, It is hard to bear. But what makes it easier is the realization of the poisoned atmosphere in Germany. That makes it easier because its actually no loss. Where I am, there is Germany. I carry my German culture in me. I have contact with the world and I do not consider myself fallen. Like Bertolt Brecht, Lion Feuchtwanger and Arnold Schoenberg, Mann ended up living in a German enclave that became known as Weimar on the Pacific. Mann was not only the most prominent member of the exiles, but also the one who had probably traveled the furthest politically. In 1937, the German philosopher Gnther Anders observed: his enemies will be amazed by the tragic violence of a man they had always derided as the master of ceremonies of German prose. They will be amazed all the more by the fact that Mann speaks as a patriot, thus seizing the claim staked out by the present rulers of Germany. There can be no doubting that Mann had performed something of a volte-face. During World War I, Mann had written a murky paean to German nationalism, Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man. It was supposed to serve as a counter-blast to his older brother Heinrichs woolly-headed humanitarian socialist beliefs. Mann, a lifelong neurasthenic who shirked service in the imperial army and recorded his medical ailments with unswerving fidelity in his diaries, loftily termed Reflections a kind of intellectual military service. He declared that the countrys essential mission was battling the decadent Western democracies. Mann, who believed France and England were intent upon foisting doctrines that were foreign and poisonous to the German character, held that the profundity of its culture meant that the German nation was itself fated to transcend mere politics. Mann went to town: I myself confess that I am deeply convinced that the German people will never be able to love political democracy simply because they cannot love politics itself, and that the much decried authoritarian state is and remains the one that is proper and becoming to the German people, and the one they basically want. After World War I, Mann, who was living in Munich, had good reason to alter his sentiments as he watched Hitlers alarming rise in what the Nazis termed the Hauptstadt der Bewegung, or capital of the movement. It was a case of disorder and early sorrow for the fledgling Weimar Republic. Mann, who had married Katia Pringsheim, the daughter of a wealthy Munich Jewish industrialist in 1905, was a staunch supporter of Weimar. Already in 1921 he had dismissed the nascent Nazi party as Swastika nonsense. His novel The Magic Mountain, which appeared in 1924, acutely diagnosed the malady afflicting Central Europe. Mann has one of his characters, the fanatical Jesuit priest Leo Naptha, aver, [t]he mystery and precept of our age is not liberation and development of the ego. What our age needs, what it demands, what it will create for itself, isterror. After Hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933, Mann and his family moved to Switzerland. For several years, Mann was reticent about events in Germany, fearful of being sundered from his readership by the Nazi regime. He did not attack the Third Reich publicly until February 1936, when he denounced German anti-Semitism in an open letter in the Neue Zricher Zeitung, stating that the barbaric campaign Hitlers paladins were waging was aimed, essentially, not at the Jews at all, or not at them exclusively. It is aimed at Europe and at the real spirit of Germany. Manns broadside prompted The New Republic to write an editorial in April 1936 praising him: It is news in the international republic of letters when Thomas Mann comes out in opposition to the new Germany. IN THOMAS Manns War, Tobias Boes carefully scrutinizes Manns embrace of his leading role in that cosmopolitan literary fraternity. By the late 1930s, Mann had come to embrace Johann Wolfgang von Goethes famous dictum in his conversations with Johann Peter Eckermann that the nation-state would become a less significant arbiter of literary greatness and that the epoch of world literature is at hand. Boes, who is a professor of German at the University of Notre Dame, maintains that this was at the core of Manns conception of himself as a writer in exile and anti-fascist polemicist. Boes superb account is based on extensive archival research, including Manns personal letters, as well as keen assessments of his novels. It maintains that during his stay in America, Mann reinvented himself as a public figure. He wrote several influential essays attacking Nazism, held a series of lectures at the Library of Congress that were often attended by prominent government officials and met Franklin D. Roosevelt several times. He became not only an embodiment of German culture for Americans, but also a personal antagonist of Hitler. One of Manns most revealing publications in America was thus the essay Brother Hitler. It originally appeared in Esquire in 1939 under the title That Man is My Brother. In it, Mann performed a reckoning with his own past, contending that Nazism was centered in cultural movements of the fin de sicle era and that he had, more or less, drawn upon them in his own works. Mann emphasized that Hitler was a disappointed bohemian artist and drew links between him and his own characters such as the snobbish artistic dreamer Detlev Spinell, the protagonist of the short story Tristan. Even Death in Venice, Mann wrote, strayed into dangerous waters with its talk of simplification and resolution of mind. It contained, Mann wrote, ideas which twenty years later were to be the property of the man in the street. Boes perceptively notes that Mann also linked the artist to the dictator by suggesting that Hitler had simply discovered a broader canvas on which to limn his sanguinary vision, relying on incantatory tools of political persuasion rather than rational ones. The fascist rallies, the torchlight parades, the smoking braziersall were, at bottom, debased Wagernian spectacles that were fashioned to sweep their spectators into a frenzied delirium of loyalty to the Fhrer, a phenomenon that historians ranging from George Mosse to Frederic Spotts have explicated in analyzing German culture and Nazism. Unlike Walter Benjamin, who wanted art to be subordinated to politics, Mann asserted that it was the task of the artist to recapture his implements from the dictator: More clearly and happily than ever will the artist of the future realize his mission as a white enchanter, as a winged, hermetic, moon-sib mediator between life and spirit. Mann had created, or at least announced, a manifesto that would preoccupy him over the next decade. The reference to a winged, hermetic, moon-sib mediator was an allusion to Mann himself, who identified with the Greek god Hermes. Boes is on the case: Art, harnessed for ill ends, had given rise to Nazism and as an artist Mann was better positioned than nearly anybody else to diagnose this problem. At the same time, the democracies of the future would clearly require the support of artists, whose task it would be to stay alert to any misappropriation of their trade. BOES DOES not mention it, but for all his rebarbative pronouncements about the West in Reflections, Mann had drawn a flattering portrait of Americans in his beguiling 1909 novel Royal Highnessa kind of fairytale that features a spunky American heiress named Imma Spoelmann who marries Prince Klaus Heinrich, thereby helping to rescue a German principality gone to seed. Now, Mann had to plight his troth to the New World. The Lbeck patrician, the literary sage, the apostle of Goethe and Schiller, had to take a backseat to his new incarnation as an anti-fascist warrior. He hit the social circuit, delivering lectures, interviews and banquet speeches. He became a Mann for all seasons. In the 1920s and early 1930s, Boes writes, Mann was typically photographed with averted eyes, furrowed brows and pen in hand: the joint effect of these conventions was to give him a remote, intellectual appearancethe visage of a man whose genius was best approached through his writing. Now the author began to eclipse his own literary work. Manns American photos showed him in a very different pose, turned directly towards the viewer, seated in an armchair and dangling a cigarette. According to Boes, ",

          "Three or was it four? days after he shut himself in a pitch-black bathroom, Rich Alati started to hallucinate. He saw little white, bubble-like balls, floating around the room. To calm himself he imagined he was in a magical cloud, cozy and relaxed. Embracing the visions was key. Or else, he says, you might get a little scared.Alati was in the dark for a bet, which makes a little more sense once you know he is a professional poker player. On 10 September last year, the American was sitting at a poker table at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, when he was asked a question by a fellow professional player, Rory Young: how much would it take for him to spend time in complete isolation, with no light, for 30 days? An hour later a price had been agreed: $100,000.Young would hand over the money if Alati could last 30 days in a soundproofed bathroom with no light. He would be delivered food from a local restaurant, but the meals would come at irregular intervals to prevent him from keeping track of time. There would be no TV, radio, phone or access to the outside world but he would be allowed some comforts: a yoga mat, resistance band, massage ball, and, appropriately for a bathroom, lavender essential oils as well as a sugar and salt scrub. If Alati failed he would have to pay Young $100,000.Poker players are known to bet on just about anything but some thought Alati had taken things too far. I wouldnt do this bet for any amount of money, professional poker player Danielle Moon Anderson noted at the time. Dr Michael Munro, a psychologist Young consulted before agreeing to the bet, told Young: Even if he lasts for 30 days, it will be extremely taxing on his mental health for the short and potentially long term.Theres good reason for such caution. Solitary confinement is often used as punishment, most notably in the United States, where inmates in solitary are isolated in their cells 23 hours a day. The United Nations Nelson Mandela Rules state that keeping someone in solitary for more than 15 days constitutes torture.Dr Terry Kupers, a psychiatrist at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, says the bet risked trivializing solitary confinement. Anxiety, anger and despair, often with a high risk of suicide, is the average clinical presentation of prisoners in solitary, he says.While there would be notable differences between Alatis experiences and those of a prisoner in solitary most notably, he could leave at any time Young believed the American was unlikely to last the 30 days. Its just so cruel to the human mind to do that, he says.But Alati was confident. He had practiced meditation and yoga, and was certain his experiences at silent retreats would help him. On 21 November, a crowd of families and friends gathered at the house where the challenge would take place. Alati and Youngs lawyers were there as well as cameramen from a production company interested in buying television rights to the story. For that reason, as well as safety, the entire bet would be recorded. Alatis father was given the power to pull Alati out at any time should he show signs of not being in the right headspace, as Alati puts it.At 8.05pm, Alati walked into the bathroom, and darkness fell. He stood for a moment, frozen. Then he lay down and fell asleep.The bathroom mirrors were covered to prevent any reflection, and the doors, though unlocked, were sealed to block out any light. A mattress was wedged between the sink and a countertop. In front of the sink and next to the mattress was Alatis yoga mat. And across from that was the bathtub.My memory is really good, Alati says. He had examined the room before the challenge started, and when he woke up in complete darkness, he could picture his surroundings. He told himself that he should do what he normally does when he wakes up, and began his routine.He brushed his teeth. He then filled up the bathtub, adding Epsom salts and lavender oil to calm his mind, and scoured himself with the sugar and salt scrub. From the bath, he went to the shower in the corner of the room to rinse off. He then headed to the sink, where he used Q-tips on his ears, combed his hair, and lotioned his body. He got dressed and ate. He did yoga and meditated. I was remembering where everything is, and everything goes back to that exact place, Alati says. Thats how I live my life anyways.And that was his plan. He was going to live his normal life as if normal was living in darkness for the rest of my life. He had 720 hours and absolutely no distractions and hed use that time to improve himself. How can I give myself a better sugar scrub ... how can I stretch it deeper, how can I be more calm, how can I be more patient? he says.From the outside his life was, well, a little dull. Young, who had began watching the video stream in earnest, said it became a bit boring after a while because its not like hes doing anything different.The biggest hurdles were mental. As well as the hallucinations, his thoughts twice started to spiral negatively, fast. It happened so quick. It went from positive thoughts to like what if, what if, what if? Alati says. Such thoughts were dangerous without company to distract him. In isolation, they could lead to despair. When they cropped up, Alati started doing yoga, and he refocused on his body, on his pose and stretch.Some parts were easier. With so much time and only himself for company, Alatis thoughts were a source of entertainment and a lifeline. The thoughts would just come to you, and if you dont make sure that they go in a good direction, they can spiderweb out of control and lead you to a bad place, Alati says.Rich Alati says he has learned to value small pleasures since his challenge. Photograph: Rich AlatiAround the 10-day mark, Young started to worry that Alati might make the 30 days, noting he looked totally fine. He worried he had miscalculated: Young hadnt known Alati a gregarious, fast talker for long before they had made the bet. His personality did not reflect that of someone who was proficient with meditation, Young said.On day 15, Youngs voice came on over the loudspeaker. Alati jumped out of bed, happy to hear a voice that wasnt his own. Young told Alati that he had been in for around two weeks and that he had an offer for him: Alati could leave if he paid out $50,000.Alatis laughed in disbelief. You cant be serious, Alati recalls telling Young. Dude, I just sat in here for two weeks, and you want me to hand over half my money? He laid back down discouraged. Hed spent 15 long days in the bathroom no walk in the park in his words and he had to gear up for 15 more.It was a pretty aggressive negotiation tactic by me, Young concedes. He waited a few days and came back with another offer. Alati was skeptical. I dont know, kid, your buyout offers are trash, Alati recalls telling Young. Young offered to pay Alati $25,000 to come out. The money was finally in Alatis favor. He considered the offer for an hour and then declined.SocialAlati waited for a few days until Young came back on the loudspeaker and asked if he had any offers of his own. Alati said he wouldnt come out for less than $75,000, to which Young countered with an offer of $40,000. They settled on $62,400. Alati had had been in the silence and dark for 20 days.Young was relieved. He had come to a gradual realization that he hadnt given enough weight to the fact that Alati was there by choice. So if youre in solitary confinement in prison, thats a scary situation. You dont know if youre going to get out ever, he said. Here, if he lasts, he gets 100k, but these guys in solitary confinement get nothing they have to do that.Kupers says that distinction remembering why he is there, that it is not permanent is crucial. Prisoners in solitary confinement tell me they are afraid they will never be released and they will die in solitary.Alati, after his own taste of isolation, agrees. [Prisoners in solitary] are not given a bathtub with sugar scrubs, and essential oil and food, and a yoga mat. Theyre not given that stuff, so if I didnt have that stuff, and I wasnt actually free and I wasnt being paid, thats why [it would be a] punishment.Alati was ready to leave the bathroom. He put on eclipse sunglasses, which blocked out any light, to protect his eyes. When he finally emerged, the noise and commotion was overwhelming. He was handed a phone, and Alati looked at it for a moment, remembering that life existed with phones and technology, before he began speaking into it. It was his sister.Friends and family surrounded him, and social interaction was a bit of a culture shock. He was surprised by the number of choices he had and that social niceties needed to be observed. I knew how to do everything I just forgot, Alati says. I cant just start doing push-ups on a bathtub in front of people. I cant just start walking around with no underwear.Despite paying out $62,400, Young is happy he took the bet. I think it is a good story of when two people want to test whether they can do something, they do it in a fair environment and can work together, and even though one of us lost a sizable chunk of money, we both feel great about it.Alati says he is happy, too. He hopes his story serves as a positive for others about overcoming challenges in a world of bad news. He says he has learned to value patience and things we take for granted, like chairs, tables and lamps or simply being outside.

        "url_text": "Three or was it four? days after he shut himself in a pitch-black bathroom, Rich Alati started to hallucinate. He saw little white, bubble-like balls, floating around the room. To calm himself he imagined he was in a magical cloud, cozy and relaxed. Embracing the visions was key. Or else, he says, you might get a little scared.Alati was in the dark for a bet, which makes a little more sense once you know he is a professional poker player. On 10 September last year, the American was sitting at a poker table at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, when he was asked a question by a fellow professional player, Rory Young: how much would it take for him to spend time in complete isolation, with no light, for 30 days? An hour later a price had been agreed: $100,000.Young would hand over the money if Alati could last 30 days in a soundproofed bathroom with no light. He would be delivered food from a local restaurant, but the meals would come at irregular intervals to prevent him from keeping track of time. There would be no TV, radio, phone or access to the outside world but he would be allowed some comforts: a yoga mat, resistance band, massage ball, and, appropriately for a bathroom, lavender essential oils as well as a sugar and salt scrub. If Alati failed he would have to pay Young $100,000.Poker players are known to bet on just about anything but some thought Alati had taken things too far. I wouldnt do this bet for any amount of money, professional poker player Danielle Moon Anderson noted at the time. Dr Michael Munro, a psychologist Young consulted before agreeing to the bet, told Young: Even if he lasts for 30 days, it will be extremely taxing on his mental health for the short and potentially long term.Theres good reason for such caution. Solitary confinement is often used as punishment, most notably in the United States, where inmates in solitary are isolated in their cells 23 hours a day. The United Nations Nelson Mandela Rules state that keeping someone in solitary for more than 15 days constitutes torture.Dr Terry Kupers, a psychiatrist at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, says the bet risked trivializing solitary confinement. Anxiety, anger and despair, often with a high risk of suicide, is the average clinical presentation of prisoners in solitary, he says.While there would be notable differences between Alatis experiences and those of a prisoner in solitary most notably, he could leave at any time Young believed the American was unlikely to last the 30 days. Its just so cruel to the human mind to do that, he says.But Alati was confident. He had practiced meditation and yoga, and was certain his experiences at silent retreats would help him. On 21 November, a crowd of families and friends gathered at the house where the challenge would take place. Alati and Youngs lawyers were there as well as cameramen from a production company interested in buying television rights to the story. For that reason, as well as safety, the entire bet would be recorded. Alatis father was given the power to pull Alati out at any time should he show signs of not being in the right headspace, as Alati puts it.At 8.05pm, Alati walked into the bathroom, and darkness fell. He stood for a moment, frozen. Then he lay down and fell asleep.The bathroom mirrors were covered to prevent any reflection, and the doors, though unlocked, were sealed to block out any light. A mattress was wedged between the sink and a countertop. In front of the sink and next to the mattress was Alatis yoga mat. And across from that was the bathtub.My memory is really good, Alati says. He had examined the room before the challenge started, and when he woke up in complete darkness, he could picture his surroundings. He told himself that he should do what he normally does when he wakes up, and began his routine.He brushed his teeth. He then filled up the bathtub, adding Epsom salts and lavender oil to calm his mind, and scoured himself with the sugar and salt scrub. From the bath, he went to the shower in the corner of the room to rinse off. He then headed to the sink, where he used Q-tips on his ears, combed his hair, and lotioned his body. He got dressed and ate. He did yoga and meditated. I was remembering where everything is, and everything goes back to that exact place, Alati says. Thats how I live my life anyways.And that was his plan. He was going to live his normal life as if normal was living in darkness for the rest of my life. He had 720 hours and absolutely no distractions and hed use that time to improve himself. How can I give myself a better sugar scrub ... how can I stretch it deeper, how can I be more calm, how can I be more patient? he says.From the outside his life was, well, a little dull. Young, who had began watching the video stream in earnest, said it became a bit boring after a while because its not like hes doing anything different.The biggest hurdles were mental. As well as the hallucinations, his thoughts twice started to spiral negatively, fast. It happened so quick. It went from positive thoughts to like what if, what if, what if? Alati says. Such thoughts were dangerous without company to distract him. In isolation, they could lead to despair. When they cropped up, Alati started doing yoga, and he refocused on his body, on his pose and stretch.Some parts were easier. With so much time and only himself for company, Alatis thoughts were a source of entertainment and a lifeline. The thoughts would just come to you, and if you dont make sure that they go in a good direction, they can spiderweb out of control and lead you to a bad place, Alati says.Rich Alati says he has learned to value small pleasures since his challenge. Photograph: Rich AlatiAround the 10-day mark, Young started to worry that Alati might make the 30 days, noting he looked totally fine. He worried he had miscalculated: Young hadnt known Alati a gregarious, fast talker for long before they had made the bet. His personality did not reflect that of someone who was proficient with meditation, Young said.On day 15, Youngs voice came on over the loudspeaker. Alati jumped out of bed, happy to hear a voice that wasnt his own. Young told Alati that he had been in for around two weeks and that he had an offer for him: Alati could leave if he paid out $50,000.Alatis laughed in disbelief. You cant be serious, Alati recalls telling Young. Dude, I just sat in here for two weeks, and you want me to hand over half my money? He laid back down discouraged. Hed spent 15 long days in the bathroom no walk in the park in his words and he had to gear up for 15 more.It was a pretty aggressive negotiation tactic by me, Young concedes. He waited a few days and came back with another offer. Alati was skeptical. I dont know, kid, your buyout offers are trash, Alati recalls telling Young. Young offered to pay Alati $25,000 to come out. The money was finally in Alatis favor. He considered the offer for an hour and then declined.SocialAlati waited for a few days until Young came back on the loudspeaker and asked if he had any offers of his own. Alati said he wouldnt come out for less than $75,000, to which Young countered with an offer of $40,000. They settled on $62,400. Alati had had been in the silence and dark for 20 days.Young was relieved. He had come to a gradual realization that he hadnt given enough weight to the fact that Alati was there by choice. So if youre in solitary confinement in prison, thats a scary situation. You dont know if youre going to get out ever, he said. Here, if he lasts, he gets 100k, but these guys in solitary confinement get nothing they have to do that.Kupers says that distinction remembering why he is there, that it is not permanent is crucial. Prisoners in solitary confinement tell me they are afraid they will never be released and they will die in solitary.Alati, after his own taste of isolation, agrees. [Prisoners in solitary] are not given a bathtub with sugar scrubs, and essential oil and food, and a yoga mat. Theyre not given that stuff, so if I didnt have that stuff, and I wasnt actually free and I wasnt being paid, thats why [it would be a] punishment.Alati was ready to leave the bathroom. He put on eclipse sunglasses, which blocked out any light, to protect his eyes. When he finally emerged, the noise and commotion was overwhelming. He was handed a phone, and Alati looked at it for a moment, remembering that life existed with phones and technology, before he began speaking into it. It was his sister.Friends and family surrounded him, and social interaction was a bit of a culture shock. He was surprised by the number of choices he had and that social niceties needed to be observed. I knew how to do everything I just forgot, Alati says. I cant just start doing push-ups on a bathtub in front of people. I cant just start walking around with no underwear.Despite paying out $62,400, Young is happy he took the bet. I think it is a good story of when two people want to test whether they can do something, they do it in a fair environment and can work together, and even though one of us lost a sizable chunk of money, we both feel great about it.Alati says he is happy, too. He hopes his story serves as a positive for others about overcoming challenges in a world of bad news. He says he has learned to value patience and things we take for granted, like chairs, tables and lamps or simply being outside. We truly go about our day to day and put up these blinders because theres so much distraction, but if you just look at the world with a different perspective and just see it, this is something, he says. This is really something. ",

          "Pragmatic choices like this one, or like the decision his grandparents made when their sons were conscripted, recur in his fictionsituations that present equally unconscionable choices on either side of a moral fulcrum. An episode in the trilogy depicts Earth on the verge of destruction. A scientist named Cheng Xin encounters a gaggle of schoolchildren as she and an assistant prepare to flee the planet. The spaceship can accommodate the weight of only three of the children, and Cheng, who is the trilogys closest embodiment of Western liberal values, is paralyzed by the choice before her. Her assistant leaps into action, however, and poses three math problems. The three children who are quickest to answer correctly are ushered on board. Cheng stares at her assistant in horror, but the young woman says, Dont look at me like that. I gave them a chance. Competition is necessary for survival.No one is more aware than Liu of the connection between the ambitions of sci-fi and the tendency of Chinese history to eclipse the individual. In an afterword to the English edition of The Three-Body Problem, he recalls a visit to his grandparents in Henan that coincided with the great flood of 1975. In a single day, forty inches of rain fell and more than fifty dams collapsed. In the course of a few days, nearly a quarter of a million people died. Recalling his experience as a twelve-year-old in a landscape teeming with barefoot refugees draped in cloth sacks instead of clothes, he writes, I thought I was looking at the end of the world.The great flourishing of science fiction in the West at the end of the nineteenth century occurred alongside unprecedented technological progress and the proliferation of the popular presstransformations that were fundamental to the development of the genre. As the British Empire expanded and the United States began to assert its power around the world, British and American writers invented tales of space travel as seen through a lens of imperial appropriation, in which technological superiority brought about territorial conquest. Extraterrestrials were often a proxy for human beings of different creeds or races. M. P. Shiels novel Yellow Danger (1898) imagined a fiendish Chinese plan to take over the world, and warned that the bony visage of the yellow man, in moments of unbridled lust and mad excitement, is a brutal spectacle. The most famous novel of the era, H. G. Wellss The War of the Worlds (1898), in which Martians attack an unsuspecting Earth, was inspired by the violent struggle in early-nineteenth-century Tasmania between Aboriginal people and white settlers, in which the indigenous population was almost completely obliterated.I dont knownone of these cookies offer an engaging brand narrative.Wellss science fiction greatly impressed Lu Xun, a writer who is considered the father of modern Chinese literature, and whose translations of Wells and Verne introduced the genre to China. Lu hoped that incorporating scientific thought into popular fiction could help remedy intellectual poverty and provide a means of leading the Chinese masses on the way to progress. Lu, born in 1881, had witnessed the drama of Chinas ancient civilization brought low by younger, more technologically advanced European ones; the Chinese might be more populous than the Tasmanians, but could they suffer the same fate?Early Chinese sci-fi imagined a China that caught up with the West and then outstripped it. Liang Qichaos The Future of New China (1902) is set in 1962; in the story, Shanghai hosts the Worlds Fair, a geopolitically dominant China has developed a multiparty system, and Westerners study the Chinese in the hope of bettering themselves. In China in Ten Years, a popular story published anonymously in 1923, China develops laser weapons to repel Western imperialists. Joel Martinsen, the translator of the second volume of Lius trilogy, sees the series as a continuation of this tradition. Its not hard to read parallels between the Trisolarans and imperialist designs on China, driven by hunger for resources and fear of being wiped out, he told me. Even Liu, unwilling as he is to endorse comparisons between the plot and Chinas current face-off with the U.S., did at one point let slip that the relationship between politics and science fiction cannot be underestimated.When the Communists came to power, science fiction presented itself as a handy way of furthering Maos Campaign of Marching Toward Science and Technology. Sci-fi would stimulate the interest of children and adolescents, and encourage them to contribute to the countrys modernization. But during the Cultural Revolution the genre was banned, along with other nonrevolutionary literature, and even science itself was subjected to ideological-purity tests. In astronomy, discussion of sunspots was forbidden, because the literal meaning of the Chinese term is solar black spots, and black was the color associated with counter-revolutionaries.Science fiction made a resurgence in the early years of Deng Xiaopings reformist regime, when Liu was writing at night while maintaining his engineering day job. It was scrutinized more closely again in the years immediately after the Tiananmen protests, when he was beginning work on Supernova Era. The genre has now been steadily thriving for a couple of decades, but its not inconceivable that the political winds could change again, as Xi Jinpings government seeks to establish increasingly rigid cultural control. Speculative fiction is the art of imagining alternative worlds, and the same political establishment that permits it to be used as propaganda for the existing regime is also likely to recognize its capacity to interrogate the legitimacy of the status quo.In my days with Liu, he repeatedly played down any sense of state interference, but the issue emerged glancingly when we began discussing the great Polish sci-fi writer Stanisaw Lem, whom Liu reveres. Whats remarkable is that he lived and wrote in Soviet Poland! he said. Yet he managed to be as beloved in the East as he was in the West. I asked how he thought Lem had managed it. He had a wondrous imagination, truly one of a kind, Liu replied. Still, even Lem did not wholly escape his governments crackdown on free speech. When questioned about stories that seemed to allude to Stalinist conformism and paranoia, Lem said the same thing that Liu says about geopolitical interpretations of his trilogythat he was not writing a veiled assessment of the present but merely making up stories.One day, Liu and I went to lunch at a Chinese restaurant not far from his hotel. It was half past two and the restaurant was empty, a void of crisp white tablecloths, punctuated by tacky, oversized ceramic vases. Large TV screens burbled to themselves in every corner. As soon as we sat down, Liu called a waiter over and asked for two beers. I said I wouldnt be drinking, but Liu clarified that he was happy to lay claim to both bottles. After the waiter had brought BudweiserI dont discriminate: beer is beerLiu gingerly pulled a bottle of Southern Comfort from his backpack and poured generously into his drink. He had bought the bottle the day before at a liquor store. I couldnt make out the labels, he said, explaining that hed picked whatever was cheap and easy to reach on the shelf. I chose wrongthis stuff is way too sweet. Several times during our days together, he alluded both to his dependence on alcohol and to the need to abstain from hard liquor for the sake of his health. At least two of my former colleagues have drunk themselves to death, he said matter-of-factly. Its not uncommon among engineers. You know the type.Types are central to the way Liu thinks of people; he has a knack for quickly sketching the various classes that make up Chinese society. A scientist is described as nothing more than a typical intellectual of the period: cautious, timid, seeking only to protect himself. Another character, a typical political cadre of the time, had an extremely keen sense for politics and saw everything through an ideological lens. This characteristic endows his fiction with a sociopolitical specificity that has the texture of reality. At the same time, it doesnt allow for much emotional complexity, and Liu has been criticized for peopling his books with characters who seem like cardboard cutouts installed in magnificent dioramas. Liu readily admits to the charge. I did not begin writing for love of literature, he told me. I did so for love of science.Lius stories typically emerge from a speculative idea that has the potential to generate a vivid, evocative fablemore often than not, one about mankinds ability to bring about its own demise. The Three-Body Problem takes its title from an analytical problem in orbital mechanics which has to do with the unpredictable motion of three bodies under mutual gravitational pull. Reading an article about the problem, Liu thought, What if the three bodies were three suns? How would intelligent life on a planet in such a solar system develop? From there, a structure gradually took shape that almost resembles a planetary system, with characters orbiting the central conceit like moons. For better or worse, the characters exist to support the framework of the story rather than to live as individuals on the page.Lius imagination is dauntingly capacious, his narratives conceived on a scale that feels, at times, almost hallucinogenic. The time line of the trilogy spans 18,906,450 years, encompassing ancient Egypt, the Qin dynasty, the Byzantine Empire, the Cultural Revolution, the present, and a time eighteen million years in the future. One scene is told from the perspective of an ant. The first book is set on Earth, though some of its scenes take place in virtual reality; by the end of the third book, the scope of the action is interstellar and annihilation unfolds across several dimensions. The London Review of Books has called the trilogy one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written.Much of the books resonance, however, comes from the fact that they also offer a faithful portrait of Chinas stringently hierarchical bureaucracy, that labyrinthine product of Communism. August Cole, a co-author of Ghost Fleet, a techno-thriller about a war between the U.S. and China, told me that, for him, Lius work was crucial to understanding contemporary China, because it synthesizes multiple angles of looking at the country, from the anthropological to the political to the social. Although physics furnishes the novels premises, it is politics that drives the plots. At every turn, the characters are forced to make brutal calculations in which moral absolutism is pitted against the greater good. In their pursuit of survival, men and women employ Machiavellian game theory and adopt a bleak consequentialism. In Lius fictional universe, idealism is fatal and kindness an exorbitant luxury. As one general says in the trilogy, In a time of war, we cant afford to be too scrupulous. Indeed, it is usually when people do not play by the rules of Realpolitik that the most lives are lost.Lius posture slackened slightly as we ate. The drinks had warmed him, and the heat of Sichuanese peppercorns seemed to stir him from his usual reticence. I decided to inch the conversation toward politics, a topic he prefers to avoid. His views turned out to be staunch and unequivocal. The infamous one-child policy, he said, had been vital: Or else how could the country have combatted its exploding population growth? He was deaf to the argument that the population growth was itself the result of a previous policy, from the fifties, in which the Party had declared that a larger population means greater manpower. Liu took a similarly pragmatic view of a controversial funeral-reform law, which mandates cremation, even though the tradition of returning to the ground has been part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. (There were reports of elderly people committing suicide in order to be buried before the ban went into effect.) If there are dead bodies everywhere, where are we supposed to plant crops? Liu said. Humans must adjust their habits to accommodate changing circumstances.When I brought up the mass internment of Muslim Uighursaround a million are now in reducation camps in the northwestern province of Xinjianghe trotted out the familiar arguments of government-controlled media: Would you rather that they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist attacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty. The answer duplicated government propaganda so exactly that I couldnt help asking Liu if he ever thought he might have been brainwashed. I know what you are thinking, he told me with weary clarity. What about individual liberty and freedom of governance? He sighed, as if exhausted by a debate going on in his head. But thats not what Chinese people care about. For ordinary folks, its the cost of health care, real-estate prices, their childrens education. Not democracy. ",
          "\"When a reporter recently challenged Liu to answer the middle-school questions about the “meaning” and the “central themes” of his story, he didn’t get a single one right. “I’m a writer,” he told me, with a shrug. “I don’t begin with some conceit in mind.

Wellss The War of the Worlds (1898), in which Martians attack an unsuspecting Earth, was inspired by the violent struggle in early-nineteenth-century Tasmania between Aboriginal people and white settlers, in which the indigenous population was almost completely obliterated.I dont knownone of these cookies offer an engaging brand narrative.Wellss science fiction greatly impressed Lu Xun, a writer who is considered the father of modern Chinese literature, and whose translations of Wells and Verne introduced the genre to China. Lu hoped that incorporating scientific thought into popular fiction could help remedy intellectual poverty and provide a means of leading the Chinese masses on the way to progress. Lu, born in 1881, had witnessed the drama of Chinas ancient civilization brought low by younger, more technologically advanced European ones; the Chinese might be more populous than the Tasmanians, but could they suffer the same fate?Early Chinese sci-fi imagined a China that caught up with the West and then outstripped it. Liang Qichaos The Future of New China (1902) is set in 1962; in the story, Shanghai hosts the Worlds Fair, a geopolitically dominant China has developed a multiparty system, and Westerners study the Chinese in the hope of bettering themselves. In China in Ten Years, a popular story published anonymously in 1923, China develops laser weapons to repel Western imperialists. Joel Martinsen, the translator of the second volume of Lius trilogy, sees the series as a continuation of this tradition. Its not hard to read parallels between the Trisolarans and imperialist designs on China, driven by hunger for resources and fear of being wiped out, he told me. Even Liu, unwilling as he is to endorse comparisons between the plot and Chinas current face-off with the U.S., did at one point let slip that the relationship between politics and science fiction cannot be underestimated.When the Communists came to power, science fiction presented itself as a handy way of furthering Maos Campaign of Marching Toward Science and Technology. Sci-fi would stimulate the interest of children and adolescents, and encourage them to contribute to the countrys modernization. But during the Cultural Revolution the genre was banned, along with other nonrevolutionary literature, and even science itself was subjected to ideological-purity tests. In astronomy, discussion of sunspots was forbidden, because the literal meaning of the Chinese term is solar black spots, and black was the color associated with counter-revolutionaries.Science fiction made a resurgence in the early years of Deng Xiaopings reformist regime, when Liu was writing at night while maintaining his engineering day job. It was scrutinized more closely again in the years immediately after the Tiananmen protests, when he was beginning work on Supernova Era. The genre has now been steadily thriving for a couple of decades, but its not inconceivable that the political winds could change again, as Xi Jinpings government seeks to establish increasingly rigid cultural control. Speculative fiction is the art of imagining alternative worlds, and the same political establishment that permits it to be used as propaganda for the existing regime is also likely to recognize its capacity to interrogate the legitimacy of the status quo.In my days with Liu, he repeatedly played down any sense of state interference, but the issue emerged glancingly when we began discussing the great Polish sci-fi writer Stanisaw Lem, whom Liu reveres. Whats remarkable is that he lived and wrote in Soviet Poland! he said. Yet he managed to be as beloved in the East as he was in the West. I asked how he thought Lem had managed it. He had a wondrous imagination, truly one of a kind, Liu replied. Still, even Lem did not wholly escape his governments crackdown on free speech. When questioned about stories that seemed to allude to Stalinist conformism and paranoia, Lem said the same thing that Liu says about geopolitical interpretations of his trilogythat he was not writing a veiled assessment of the present but merely making up stories.One day, Liu and I went to lunch at a Chinese restaurant not far from his hotel. It was half past two and the restaurant was empty, a void of crisp white tablecloths, punctuated by tacky, oversized ceramic vases. Large TV screens burbled to themselves in every corner. As soon as we sat down, Liu called a waiter over and asked for two beers. I said I wouldnt be drinking, but Liu clarified that he was happy to lay claim to both bottles. After the waiter had brought BudweiserI dont discriminate: beer is beerLiu gingerly pulled a bottle of Southern Comfort from his backpack and poured generously into his drink. He had bought the bottle the day before at a liquor store. I couldnt make out the labels, he said, explaining that hed picked whatever was cheap and easy to reach on the shelf. I chose wrongthis stuff is way too sweet. Several times during our days together, he alluded both to his dependence on alcohol and to the need to abstain from hard liquor for the sake of his health. At least two of my former colleagues have drunk themselves to death, he said matter-of-factly. Its not uncommon among engineers. You know the type.Types are central to the way Liu thinks of people; he has a knack for quickly sketching the various classes that make up Chinese society. A scientist is described as nothing more than a typical intellectual of the period: cautious, timid, seeking only to protect himself. Another character, a typical political cadre of the time, had an extremely keen sense for politics and saw everything through an ideological lens. This characteristic endows his fiction with a sociopolitical specificity that has the texture of reality. At the same time, it doesnt allow for much emotional complexity, and Liu has been criticized for peopling his books with characters who seem like cardboard cutouts installed in magnificent dioramas. Liu readily admits to the charge. I did not begin writing for love of literature, he told me. I did so for love of science.Lius stories typically emerge from a speculative idea that has the potential to generate a vivid, evocative fablemore often than not, one about mankinds ability to bring about its own demise. The Three-Body Problem takes its title from an analytical problem in orbital mechanics which has to do with the unpredictable motion of three bodies under mutual gravitational pull. Reading an article about the problem, Liu thought, What if the three bodies were three suns? How would intelligent life on a planet in such a solar system develop? From there, a structure gradually took shape that almost resembles a planetary system, with characters orbiting the central conceit like moons. For better or worse, the characters exist to support the framework of the story rather than to live as individuals on the page.Lius imagination is dauntingly capacious, his narratives conceived on a scale that feels, at times, almost hallucinogenic. The time line of the trilogy spans 18,906,450 years, encompassing ancient Egypt, the Qin dynasty, the Byzantine Empire, the Cultural Revolution, the present, and a time eighteen million years in the future. One scene is told from the perspective of an ant. The first book is set on Earth, though some of its scenes take place in virtual reality; by the end of the third book, the scope of the action is interstellar and annihilation unfolds across several dimensions. The London Review of Books has called the trilogy one of the most ambitious works of science fiction ever written.Much of the books resonance, however, comes from the fact that they also offer a faithful portrait of Chinas stringently hierarchical bureaucracy, that labyrinthine product of Communism. August Cole, a co-author of Ghost Fleet, a techno-thriller about a war between the U.S. and China, told me that, for him, Lius work was crucial to understanding contemporary China, because it synthesizes multiple angles of looking at the country, from the anthropological to the political to the social. Although physics furnishes the novels premises, it is politics that drives the plots. At every turn, the characters are forced to make brutal calculations in which moral absolutism is pitted against the greater good. In their pursuit of survival, men and women employ Machiavellian game theory and adopt a bleak consequentialism. In Lius fictional universe, idealism is fatal and kindness an exorbitant luxury. As one general says in the trilogy, In a time of war, we cant afford to be too scrupulous. Indeed, it is usually when people do not play by the rules of Realpolitik that the most lives are lost.Lius posture slackened slightly as we ate. The drinks had warmed him, and the heat of Sichuanese peppercorns seemed to stir him from his usual reticence. I decided to inch the conversation toward politics, a topic he prefers to avoid. His views turned out to be staunch and unequivocal. The infamous one-child policy, he said, had been vital: Or else how could the country have combatted its exploding population growth? He was deaf to the argument that the population growth was itself the result of a previous policy, from the fifties, in which the Party had declared that a larger population means greater manpower. Liu took a similarly pragmatic view of a controversial funeral-reform law, which mandates cremation, even though the tradition of returning to the ground has been part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. (There were reports of elderly people committing suicide in order to be buried before the ban went into effect.) If there are dead bodies everywhere, where are we supposed to plant crops? Liu said. Humans must adjust their habits to accommodate changing circumstances.When I brought up the mass internment of Muslim Uighursaround a million are now in reducation camps in the northwestern province of Xinjianghe trotted out the familiar arguments of government-controlled media: Would you rather that they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist attacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty. The answer duplicated government propaganda so exactly that I couldnt help asking Liu if he ever thought he might have been brainwashed. I know what you are thinking, he told me with weary clarity. What about individual liberty and freedom of governance? He sighed, as if exhausted by a debate going on in his head. But thats not what Chinese people care about. For ordinary folks, its the cost of health care, real-estate prices, their childrens education. Not democracy. ",
