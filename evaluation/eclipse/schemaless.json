        "TrilobitesResearch conducted during the Great American Eclipse of 2017 suggested the suns midday disappearance shocked some plants.Credit...Dr. Mario BretfeldJuly 2, 2019As the total solar eclipse crosses South America on Tuesday, it wont just be people oohing and ahhing as the sun is blotted out.Other living things will have their own responses, too some of which we are just beginning to understand. As some scientists used the Great American Eclipse in August 2017 to watch how bees and birds dealt with sudden midday darkness, researchers in Wyoming investigated big sagebrush, a shaggy, aromatic desert shrub that grows throughout the western United States.Tracking its reactions at the leaf level, scientists saw it experience a slowdown in activity as darkness fell, followed by shock at the suns surprise return. The study, published in June in Scientific Reports, adds to a small clump of botanical eclipse research, all produced by people with the ability to wonder, even as a celestial event occurs: What are the plants getting up to?[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Plants havent really been well-documented during the eclipse, said Daniel Beverly, a Ph.D. student in botany and hydrology at the University of Wyoming and the papers lead author. When he heard an eclipse was coming, he saw the chance for a once-in-a-lifetime data set.Big sagebrush spends much of its life in the sun, and it covers such a large portion of the country, from Oregon down to New Mexico, Mr. Beverly said, making it a good subject for study. He and his colleagues chose a patch close to Yellowstone National Park. They set up instruments that could measure photosynthetic rate, as well as the speed of transpiration how quickly its leaves lose water.As the light faded and the temperature dropped during the 80 or so minutes before totality, Mr. Beverly and his team saw a corresponding decrease in photosynthesis and transpiration. The plant responded as if it was dusk, he said.During the two minutes and 18 seconds of complete darkness, both rates fell further. Although they did not quite reach the slowdown level of an average nighttime, it was a much more precipitous drop than would have occurred for a passing cloud.But when the sun appeared again, the shrubs were blindsided.Thats when we saw the most evident signals of stress, said Mr. Beverly. It caused a disruption in the photosynthetic pathways.Although they could not test this directly, he guesses that the shock of sudden sunlight messed with each plants circadian rhythm the internal clock that determines an organisms daily cycle of activity.Over the course of the eclipse day, the team estimated, your average big sagebrush managed about 14 percent less photosynthesis than it would have if the sun hadnt been blocked. If a plant is already drought-stressed, an eclipse might be bad news, like losing 14 percent of a days income when youre already broke, Mr. Beverly said.Their findings follow a few other studies, including one done during an eclipse over Europe in 1999 that showed changes in sap flow and transpiration in a beech tree near Ghent, Belgium. The tree held its breath during the solar eclipse, said Kathy Steppe, now a professor of plant ecology at Ghent University meaning it stopped releasing water, even as its sap kept flowing.Mr. Beverly looks forward to the 2024 eclipse, which will sweep from Mexico through to the Eastern United States, when he plans to take a closer look at crop and tree responses.Hell do one thing differently: I would try to use as much automation as possible so I could actually enjoy the eclipse, he said. Thats a big thing I missed. ",

        "The meteorite impact caused a bright flash, indicated by the arrowJose M. Madiedo Observers of Mondays lunar eclipse were blessed with the first known sighting of a meteorite impact during such an event. The so-called super wolf blood moon was eagerly watched by millions of people around the world, mostly via live streaming video.During the eclipse,some people noticed a tiny flash, a brief yellow-white speck, popping up on the lunar surface during the online broadcasts. One Reddit user raised the possibility that this was a meteorite impactand othersscoured eclipse footage for evidence of the event. A flash is visible in at least three different videos.Advertisement Jose Maria Madiedo at the University of Huelva in Spain has confirmed that the impact is genuine.For years,he and his colleagues have been hoping to observe a meteorite impact on the moon during a lunar eclipse, but the brightness of these events can make that very difficult lunar meteorite impacts have been filmed before, but not during an eclipse. Read more: NASA puzzles over invisible moon impact On this occasion, Madiedo doubled the number of telescopes trained on different parts of the moon from four to eight in the hope of seeing an impact. I had a feeling, this time will be the time it will happen, says Madiedo. After the eclipse, software automatically pinpointed a flash in imagery recorded by several of his telescopes. This helps to confirm that the flashes seen by live stream-watchers were not just optical anomalies on camera sensors. I was really, really happy when this happened, says Madiedo. He notes that the flash was quite bright and it struck the moon at a moment when the eclipse was not overly luminous itself, perhaps making the strike easier to detect. Although he has not yet formally calculated an estimate for the size of the space rock that collided with the moon, Madiedo thinks it probably had a mass of about 2 kilograms and was roughly the size of a football. Experience Argentinas 2020 total solar eclipse: Witness a rare celestial event on a New Scientist Discovery Tour The combination of a darkened surface and a lot of people watching made it much more likely that the flash of impact was seen and it reminds us that the solar system is still a very dynamic place, says Robert Massey at the Royal Astronomical Society.

Tue, 16 Jul 19 / 01:32 Dear Shirin & Arun, Place Flight M British Standard Time Indian Standard Time Duration Distance A/C Speed Alt London BA 119 D Tue, 16 Jul / 14:25 (+01:00) Tue, 16 Jul / 18:55 (+05:30) B 777 Bengaluru A Wed, 17 Jul / 00:05 (+01:00) Wed, 17 Jul / 04:35 (+05:30) 09:40 hr 8,010 km 869 km/h 11,280 mt On Wed, 17 Jul, a Partial Lunar Eclipse begins at (all IST) 01:31:43, reaches Maximum 65% at 03:00:44 and Ends at 04:29:39. You will be landing in Bengaluru, at 04:35; just 5 minutes after the Eclipse ends. Solar Eclipses are Virtual. They really do not exist. They are Localised OUR Views of the sun, from an individual on the earth. They are no different from holding an umbrella over your head, when walking under the sun. Instead of the umbrella, you are \"holding\"the moon over your head, blocking the sun, only to you, locally; only about 30 km around you. It is about 30 km radius circle, because your umbrella is about 1 mt diametre and the moon's diametre is 3,476 km; but then, it is 362,600 km to 405,600 km away. Lunar Eclipses are real. They are actually happening of an event on the moon. The earth's shadow, is actually falling on the moon. All the persons in half earth who can see the moon, can see the Eclipse, in the same manner. When you take off from London, set your watch 04 hr 30 mt head. In that watch, when it isIndia's time, 01:31:43 (correct to the second), the Eclipse begins. You can calibrate your watch, correct to the second. Please try to get a seat on the right side, so that you can get a view on the West side. Do not sit over the wing. When the Eclipse starts at 01:32, you will be over Oman (wave to Arun's sister Anita). From Oman to Bengaluru, you willfly due South-East. You do not have to crane your neck. See the moon at level, straight through your window. This is a rare opportunity, to see the entire Lunar Eclipse of 02 hr 57 mt 56 sc through the window of a plane. Take your BEST binoculars with you. If you do not have one, purchase it in Belfast or London. At 11.28 km high, above the atmosphere, your moon sight will be in crystal clear sky. As the Earth's sharply edged shadow races across the moon's surface, at about 1,000 km per hour, through your binoculars, you will see the edge of the shadow climbing up the moon's mountains and dipping below into the valleys. From the Earth's surface, the moon appears flat. In reality, the centre of the moon is 1,738 km nearer to you. From a plane, at 11 km above the Earth's surface, as the Earth's shadow's edge races across the moon's surface, your eyes will suddenly see the moon in 3 dimensions. Just intently stare at the moon. Your brain will suddenly pop up the moon into 3 dimensions. This is a million pounds worth ofexperience, which you can NEVER have fromthe Earth's surface. Looking forward to meeting you.

In Muscat (Oman), the moon would rise at 06:39 PM GST in the East-southeast, cross the local meridian at 12:09 AM GST, and set at 05:40 AM GST in the West-southwest [1]. Therefore, when the eclipse would start at 00:02 AM GST, the moon would be in the eastern sky close to the local meridian at Muscat.But then most of the remaining eclipse seems to take place in the western sky. For example, in Bangalore, the moon would rise at 06:30 PM IST in the East-southeast, cross the local meridian at 12:20 AM IST, and set at 06:10 AM IST in the West-southwest [2]. Therefore, when the eclipse would end at 04:29 AM IST, the moon would be in the western sky ready to set in about 1.5 hours. It looks like most of the eclipse would indeed be visible in the western sky from this particular flight.[1]: https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/oman/muscat[2]: https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/india/bangaloreThanks,Susam -- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Bangalore Astronomical Society\" group.Shashikiran Kolarunread,Jul 16, 2019, 2:50:55 PM7/16/19to Bangalore Astronomical SocietyYes, as Susam says, with respect to Muscat and India, the Moon spends most of its time in the Western half of the sky when it enters the Earth's umbral shadow.Muscat is 22, or about 90 minutes, West of Bangalore. So, if the partial eclipse begins at 1.30AM here, it would do so at 12.00AM at Muscat. Since this is the full moon, it's in opposition and hence transits to Western part of the sky at (local) 12.00AM. Also, the plane would be flying Eastwards, causing the Moon would always hang in the Western part of the sky thereon.That lunar eclipses always begin at the Eastern limb of the Moon was perhaps confused with the Moon being in the Eastern half of the sky?As an aside, it is likely that certain depictions on temples indicate eclipses. In the attached picture, a snake is seen moving towards a moon (shown as a crescentto perhaps distinguish it from the Sun) and likely indicates Rahu/Ketu about to swallow the Moon causing a lunar eclipse. The temple may have been dedicated during such an event.Thanks,-ShashiRameshwara temple, Hale Palya, Hassan District, Karnataka.JPGBHU1 LORDunread,Jul 16, 2019, 2:56:15 PM7/16/19to b-...@googlegroups.comI guess I misunderstood the mail when I first read it as it was written in personal context and thought it was meant to be sent to somebody personallyBut I really appreciate the result especially regarding the accurate timings mentioned in the mailI'm eagerly waiting for the eclipse and wish all of you clear skieskeerthi kiranunread,Jul 17, 2019, 10:08:39 AM7/17/19to BASHi Susam, Shashikiran,You guys are right.

        "In May, my three year old daughter and I flew out to Vancouver Island, Canada to spend a couple of weeks with my Dad. It was my daughter’s second time out to the island, though the first time was for my Grandma’s funeral when she was six months old.<p>This email from a father to a child reminds me of the emails my Dad sent us in the lead up to our trip. I’ve never seen my Dad so excited for anything. The day of the flight, he was awake at 1am his local time to start watching the flight schedule and the weather. He wrote lots of reminders, to make sure that I packed Lauren’s identification, Pull Ups and wipes. And he wanted to make sure that Lauren had a window seat where she wouldn’t just stare out at a wing. No no no, his only granddaughter was going to have a view. (Strangely, the day of the flight was cloudy as hell until we got to the mountains, then we flew over the Rockies with barely a cloud in sight. It was as if Grandpa put in his order for weather that would give his granddaughter the best view imaginable).<p>I was pretty scared in the lead up. I hate flying at the best of times and this was my first solo flight with a three year old. Shit, I’m hardly qualified to deal with Webpack when it has a tantrum. This is a bloody human life in a plane.<p>The flight was amazing and reading my Dad’s dispatches every ten minutes added to our excitement. When we landed, my Dad and stepmother were visibly excited. My daughter ran to them and the three of them had a wonderful moment.<p>My Dad’s emails were purely about his excitement. And this dad’s email makes him sound just as excited as my Dad was. I am only going to have one child and I pray that one day, I get to be that excited about my little girl hopping on a flight to visit me. If my excited message happens to go public and it contains some factual issues, I hope to hell that the people who read it recognize it for what it is...I’ll just be a really excited dad who is doing whatever I can to pass the time before I get to see someone I love more than life! :)"

Mangou 6 , M. Zafeiropoulou 6 , R. Hadland 7 , D. Bate 7 , A. Ramsey 7 , M. Allen 7 , A. Crawley 7 , P. Hockley 7 , T. Malzbender 8 , D. Gelb 8 , W. Ambrisco 9 & M. G. Edmunds 1 The Antikythera Mechanism is a unique Greek geared device, con- structed around the end of the second century BC. It is known 19 that it calculated and displayed celestial information, particularly cycles such as the phases of the moon and a luni-solar calendar. Calendars were important to ancient societies 10 for timing agricul- tural activity and fixing religious festivals. Eclipses and planetary motions were often interpreted as omens, while the calm regular- ity of the astronomical cycles must have been philosophically attractive in an uncertain and violent world. Named after its place of discovery in 1901 in a Roman shipwreck, the Antikythera Mechanism is technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards. Its specific functions have remained controversial 1114 because its gears and the inscriptions upon its faces are only fragmentary. Here we report surface imaging and high-resolution X-ray tomography of the surviving fragments, enabling us to reconstruct the gear function and double the number of deciphered inscriptions. The mechanism predicted lunar and solar eclipses on the basis of Babylonian arithmetic- progression cycles. The inscriptions support suggestions of mech- anical display of planetary positions 9,14,15 , now lost. In the second century BC, Hipparchos developed a theory to explain the irregu- larities of the Moons motion across the sky caused by its elliptic orbit. We find a mechanical realization of this theory in the gear- ing of the mechanism, revealing an unexpected degree of technical sophistication for the period. The bronze mechanism (Fig. 1), probably hand-driven, was ori- ginally housed in a wooden-framed case 1 of (uncertain) overall size 315 3 190 3 100 mm (Fig. 2). It had front and back doors, with astronomical inscriptions covering much of the exterior of the mech- anism. Our new transcriptions and translations of the Greek texts are given in Supplementary Note 2 (glyphs and inscriptions). The detailed form of the lettering can be dated to the second half of the second century BC, implying that the mechanism was constructed during the period 150100 BC, slightly earlier than previously sug- gested 1 . This is consistent with a date of around 8060 BC for the wreck 1,16 from which the mechanism was recovered by some of the first underwater archaeology. We are able to complete the recon- struction 1 of the back door inscription with text from fragment E, and characters from fragments A and F (see Fig. 1 legend for fragment nomenclature). The front door is mainly from fragment G. The text is astronomical, with many numbers that could be related to planetary motions; the word sterigmos (STGRICMOS, translated as sta- tion or stationary point) is found, meaning where a planets appar- ent motion changes direction, and the numbers may relate to planetary cycles. We note that a major aim of this investigation is to set up a data archive to allow non-invasive future research, and access to this will start in 2007. Details will be available on www.an- tikythera-mechanism.gr. The back door inscription mixes mechanical terms about con- struction (trunnions, gnomon, perforations) with astronom- ical periods.

Figure 1 | The surviving fragments of the Antikythera Mechanism. The 82 fragments that survive in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens are shown to scale. A key and dimensions are provided in Supplementary Note 1 (fragments). The major fragments A, B, C, D are across the top, starting at top left, with E, F, G immediately below them. 27 hand-cut bronze gears are in fragment A and one gear in each of fragments B, C and D. Segments of display scales are in fragments B, C, E and F. A schematic reconstruction is given in Fig. 2. It is not certain that every one of the remaining fragments (numbered 175) belong to the mechanism. The distinctive fragment A, which contains most of the gears, is approximately 180 3 150 mm in size. We have used three principal techniques to investigate the structure and inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism. (1) Three-dimensional X-ray microfocus computed tomography 24 (CT), developed by X-Tek Systems Ltd. The use of CT has been crucial in making the text legible just beneath the current surfaces. (2) Digital optical imaging to reveal faint surface detail using polynomial texture mapping (PTM) 25,26 , developed by Hewlett- Packard Inc. (3) Digitized high-quality conventional film photography.

The references to golden little sphere and little sphere probably refer to the front zodiac display for the Sun and Moonincluding phase for the latter. The text near the lower back dial includes Pharos and from south (about/around).Spain (ISPANIA) ten. These geograph- ical references, together with previous readings 1 of towards the east, west-north-west and west-south-west suggest an eclipse function for the dial, as solar eclipses occur only at limited geograph- ical sites, and winds were often recorded 1719 in antiquity with eclipse observations. Possibly this information was added to the mechanism during use. Turning to the dials themselves, the front dial displays the position of the Sun and Moon in the zodiac, and a corresponding calendar 1 of 365 days that could be adjusted for leap years. Previously 1 , it was suggested that the upper back dial might have five concentric rings with 47 divisions per turn, showing the 235 months of the 19-year Metonic cycle. A later proposal 5 augments this with the upper sub- sidiary dial showing the 76-year Callippic cycle. Our optical and X-ray microfocus computed tomography (CT) imaging confirms these proposals, with 34 scale markings discovered on the upper back dial. On the basis of a statistical analysis analogous to that described for gear tooth counts below, we confirm the 235 total divisions. We also find from the CT that the subsidiary dial is indeed divided into quadrants 1,6 , as required for a Callippic dial. In agreement with the back door inscription, we also substantiate the perceptive proposal 5,20 that the dial is in fact a spiral, made from semicircular arcs displaced Figure 2 | A schematic view of the mechanism to illustrate the position of major inscriptions and dials. The front dial has two concentric scales. The inner scale shows the Greek zodiac with 360 divisions. There are occasional Greek letters denoting references to the Parapegma inscription, and we add three further reference letters (Z, H, H) to Prices description 1 . The Parapegma is a star almanac showing rising and settings at dawn or evening of particular stars or constellations, which we will discuss elsewhere. Its form is consistent with a date of late second century BC. The outer (originally) movable scale is a calendar carrying the Egyptian names of the months with Greek letters. The Egyptian calendar of 365 days, with twelve 30-day months and 5 extra (epagomenai) days was in standard use in Greek astronomy. The effect of the extra quarter day in a year could be corrected by turning the scale one day every four yearsand a sequence of holes to take a locking pin is observed under the scale. We find that spacing of the holes is indeed what would be expected for a total of 365 days, with a possible range 363365. The position of the Sun and Moon would have been indicated by pointers across the dial scales, and a device 7 showing the phase of the Moon was probably carried round on the lunar pointer. It is not clear whether the Sun position pointer would have been separated from a date pointer, or whether any planetary positions might have been displayed. The spiral upper back dial displays the luni-solar Metonic sequence of 235 lunar months with a subsidiary dial showing the Callippic cycle, while the spiral lower back dial displays the 223-lunar-month Saros eclipse cycle with a subsidiary dial showing the Exeligmos cycle. Box 1 | Astronomical cycles known to the Babylonians The lunar (or synodic) month is the interval between the Moon being at the same phasefor example, full moon to full moon. The Metonic cycle results from the close equality of 19 years to 235 lunar months. It represents the return to the same phase of the Moon on the same date in the year. After the cycle, the Sun, Moon and Earth are back in nearly the same relative orientations. The Moon appears to return to the same point in the sky relative to the zodiac in a sidereal month, and in 19 years there are 235 1 19 5 254 sidereal months. The 76-year Callippic cycle is four Metonic cycles minus one dayand improves the accuracy of reconciling solar years with whole numbers of lunar months. The Saros is an eclipse repeat cycle. If either a solar or lunar eclipse occurs, a very similar eclipse will occur 223 lunar months later 23 .A record of past eclipses can thus be used to predict future occurrences. The cycle arises from the coincidence of three orbital periods of the Moon. These are: (1) same phase to same phase, 223 synodic monthseclipses will of course only occur at new or full Moon in the month; (2) the lunar crossing of the Earth Sun orbital plane, 242 draconitic monthseclipses can only occur near these points (nodes) of co-alignment; (3) similar Earth Moon distances which occur on the period from apogee to apogee of the Moons orbit, 239 anomalistic months. The distance will determine the magnitude of the eclipse, ensuring the similarity of eclipses at the period of the cycle. The Saros cycle is not an integer number of days (6,585M), causing the eclipses in successive cycles to be displaced by eight hours in time (and solar eclipses, only visible at limited geographical locations, to be displaced by 120u in longitude). True repeats come after 3 Saros cycles, the 54-year Exeligmos cycle, but not with identical solar eclipse paths. LETTERS NATURE | Vol 444 | 30 November 2006 588 Natu re Pu blishin g Gro u p 2 0 0 6 to two centres on the vertical midline. In the CT of fragment B we find a new feature that explains why the dial is a spiral: a pointer-follower device (Fig. 3) travelled around the spiral groove to indicate which month (across the five turns of the scale) should be read. From our CT data of the 48 scale divisions observed in fragments A, E and F, we establish 223 divisions in the four-turn 5,20 spiral on the lower back dial, the spiral starting at the bottom of the dial. This is the Saros eclipse cycle, whose number is on the back door inscription. The 54-year Exeligmos cycle of three Saros cycles is shown on the lower subsidiary dial. Between the scale divisions of the Saros dial we have identified 16 blocks of characters, or glyphs (see Supplementary Note 2 (glyphs and inscriptions)) at intervals of one, five and six months. These are eclipse predictions and contain either S for a lunar eclipse (from SELGNG, Moon) or G for a solar eclipse (from GLIOS, Sun) or both. A correlation analysis (analogous to DNA sequence matching) with historic eclipse data 21 (all modern eclipse data and predictions in our work are from this reference) indicates that over a period of 400 1 BC, the sequence of eclipses marked by the identified glyphs would be exactly matched by 121 possible start dates. The matching only occurs if the lunar month starts at first crescent, and confirms this choice of month start in the mechanism. The sequences of eclipses can then be used to predict the expected position of glyphs on the whole dial, as seen in Fig. 4. The dial starts and finishes with an eclipse. Although Ptolemy indicates that the Greeks recorded eclipses in the second century BC, the Babylonian Saros canon 1719 is the only known source of sufficient data to construct the dial. The functions of the mechanism are determined by the tooth counts of the gears. These are based mainly on the CT, using angular measurement from a nominal centre to the remains of tooth tips. In a few cases all teeth can be seen, but many gears are incomplete. Counts are established by fitting models with regularly spaced teeth and minimising the r.m.s. deviation from the measurementsvarying the centre in software (when unclear) to find the best-fit solution or solutions (see Supplementary Note 3 (gears)). We have adopted a systematic nomenclature of lower case letters for the axis of the gear, with numbering increasing with ordering from the front of the mech- anism. Hypothetical (lost) gears are denoted by italics. Several models have been proposed for the gear trains 1,2,46,8 . We agree with the assumption of four missing gears (n1, n2, p1, p2) to drive the Metonic and Callippic dials 4 . We propose a new reconstruc- tion for the other trains, which uses all extant gears (except the lone r1 0 1 2 3 4 5 cm Figure 4 | Reconstruction of the back dials. A composite of fragments A, B, E and F. The Metonic calendar is at top, with its subsidiary Callippic dial. The Saros eclipse cycle is below, with its subsidiary Exeligmos dial. The 16 observed eclipse glyphs are shown in turquoise on the Saros dial, with 35 hypothetical glyphs in violet. The hypothetical glyphs are based on the criterion that 99% of the 121 sequences exactly matching the observed glyphs have an eclipse at the month position. Both main dials would have a pointer-follower (see Fig. 3) to indicate the relevant lunar month on the spiral. The monthly divisions on the Metonic upper back dial are not simply scribed directly across all five turns, as might be expected for simplicity of construction. There are small misalignments, implying a systematic attempt at marking full (30-day) and hollow (29-day) months. The incomplete data do not allow good analysis, other than a hint of bimodality in the interval distribution. If the marking out of the scale were carried out using the mechanisms gearing, then this would greatly pre-date known dividing engines 27 by many centuries. Figure 3 | The pointer-follower lunar month indicator of the upper back dial. On the left, false-colour sections through CT images, analysed with VGStudio Max software by Volume Graphics GmbH. These show two views at right angles of the pointer-follower in the Metonic dial in fragment B. On the right, a computer reconstruction of the device from two different angles (with the Metonic scale omitted for clarity). The pin was constrained to follow the groove between the spiral scales (the scale is shown in Fig. 4), causing the device to slide along the month pointer to indicate which ring on the spiral scale specified the month. A similar pointer-follower would have been present on the lower back (Saros) dial. The Metonic dial would have required re- setting every 19 years, the Saros dial after 18 years. The groove-pin may have been held in place by the small pin through the front of the device, enabling its removal for re-setting. NATURE | Vol 444 | 30 November 2006 LETTERS 589 Natu re Pu blishin g Gro u p 2 0 0 6 from the separate fragment D). The proposed model is shown in Fig. 5. We require the assumption of only one further gear (m3), whose proposed shaft is clearly broken off in the CT. A detailed description is contained in Supplementary Note 3 (gears). Of particular note is the dual use of the large gear, e3, at the back of the mechanism, which has found no use in previous models. In our model, it is powered by m3 as part of a fixed-axis train that turns the Saros and Exeligmos dials for eclipse prediction, and also doubles as the epicyclic table for the gears k1, k2. These are part of epicyclic gearing that calculates the theory of the irregular motion of the moon, developed by Hipparchos some time between 146 and 128 BC (ref. 22)the first anomaly, caused by its elliptical orbit about the Earth. The period of this anomaly is the period from apogee to apogee (the anomalistic month). To realize this theory, the mean sidereal lunar motion is first calculated by gears on axes c, d and e and this is then fed into the epicyclic system. As explained in Fig. 6, a pin- and-slot device on the epicyclic gears k1 and k2, clearly seen in the CT, provides the variation. This was previously identified 4 , but rejected as a lunar mechanism. The remarkable purpose of mounting the pin-and-slot mechanism on the gear e3 is to change the period of variation from sidereal month (that is, the time taken for the Moon to orbit the Earth relative to the zodiac), which would occur if k1 and k2 were on fixed axes, to anomalistic monthby carrying the gears epicyclically at a rate that is the difference between the rates of the Front dials Lunar phase Lost epicyclic gearing Pin and slot Hipparchos lunar mechanism Possibly Hipparchos solar mechanism and planetary mechanisms Hipparchos sidereal month Year Back dials Luni-solar calendar Input Eclipse prediction Saros 4Metonic 5Callippic Exeligmos Zodiac Egyptian calendar Parapegma Figure 5 | New reconstruction of the gear trains. A schematic sectional diagram (not to scale) of the gearing, following the style of Price 1 and Wright 4 . The viewpoint is looking down from the top right of the mechanism, and is stretched in the direction of the main axes to show the structure. Features that are outlined or labelled in red are hypothetical. Gears are lettered with their shaft, and numbered with increasing distance from the front dial. The two-or-three digit number on the gear is its actual or assumed tooth count (see Supplementary Note 3 (gears)). Hypothetical gears n1, n2, p1, p2 have been proposed previously, the gear m3 on the broken-off shaft m is our addition. All gears, except the lone one in fragment D, are now accounted for in the mechanism. The function of the trains is outlined in the text. We find no evidence in the CT for an idler wheel carried on e3 and between e5 and k1 or between k2 and e6, as has been previously proposed 1,2,4 . The CT shows a pin through axis e between gears e1 and e2. We believe its purpose is to retain the square-bossed e1 on the shaft, but its passage right through the axis rules out previous reconstructions 1,2,4 where e1 and e2 were joined by an outer pipe rotating around the shaft e. Figure 6 | The Hipparchos lunar mechanism mounted on gear e3. The figure is based on a CT slice of part of fragment A, showing (top) shaft e and (bottom) shaft k. The complete geometry cannot be seen in a single CT slice. The two gears on the e axis (e5 and e6) are coaxial, while the two k gears rotate on slightly displaced axes. k1 has a pin on its face that engages with a radial slot in k2 (and this was previously reported 5 ). In the figure the pitch circles of e5 and k1 are shown in turquoise and those of e6 and k2 in pink. The gear e5 drives k1, which drives k2 via the pin-and-slot, introducing a quasi-sinusoidal variation in the motion, which is then transmitted to e6. Our estimate of the distance between the arbors on the k gears is about 1.1 mm, with a pin distance of 9.6 mm, giving an angular variation of 6.5u. According to Ptolemy 28 , Hipparchos made two estimates for a lunar anomaly parameter, based on eclipse data, which would require angular variations of 5.9u or 4.5u herealthough estimates of the anomaly from Babylonian astronomy were generally larger. The difference from our estimated value is probably not significant given the difficulty of precise measurement of the axes in the CT. The harmonic variation, together with the effect of carrying the gears on e3 (which rotates at the period of the Moons apogee around the Earth), would simulate the correct variation for the Moons mean (sidereal) rotation rate on the front dial. An (unexplained) regular pentagon is visible at the centre of gear e5. It is tempting to associate the conception of the mechanism with Hipparchos himself, but he was not the first to assume eccentric or epicyclic models.

Gears with 53 teeth are awkward to divide. So it may seem sur- prising that the gearing includes two such gears (f1, l2), whose effects cancel in the train leading to the Saros dial. But the gearing has been specifically designed so that the epicyclic table e3 turns at the rate of rotation of the Moons apogeethe factor 53 being derived from the calculation of this rotation from the Metonic and Saros cycles, which are the bases for all the prime factors in the tooth counts of the gears. The establishment of the 53-tooth count of these gears is powerful confirmation of our proposed model of Hipparchos lunar theory. The output of this complex system is carried from e6 back through e3 and thence, via e1 and b3, to the zodiac scale on the front dial and the lunar phase 7 mechanism. Our CT confirms the complex structure of axis e that this model entails. The Antikythera Mechanism shows great economy and ingenuity of design.

        "At work, I was asked to learn spring boot and the first task was to build a simple crud app, just end to end functionality for a model with automated tests, builds, static code analysis etc. I hate to admit it, but for the first few days (and even now) I couldn't tell which was up and which way was down, nothing made sense.<p>- Installation was a nightmare. Workplace uses windows, so the usual dance of installing the jdk, setting the env variables, creating a project in eclipse and for some reason it uses the jre instead of the jdk. Some plugins/packages such as lombok work in eclipse but not in vs code! And even in eclipse there's some annotation (@Data I think) that's supposed to generate getters and setters but it doesn't work.<p>- Flexible architecture : some use service, serviceimpl and controllers. Some skip the service interface. And it turns out you can extend crudrepository and have a fully functioning rest endpoint without writing any code using spring data rest!<p>- Magic : this is incredibly frustrating. Some repository types are automatically exported, some are not and the docs do an atrocious job of explaing what's going on. Place some file abc.xyz in the root and magic happens!<p>- Docs : the single worst part of learning spring boot, especially for newcomers. How can the docs possibly be so insensitive to newcomers? Or do they expect only experienced devs at big cos to use spring boot?<p>- I hate to admit this, but I still don't know what a god damn bean is, what AOP is, what inversion of control is.<p>This was mainly a rant and a bad one at that, but I had to vent.",

I've used Spring and Spring Boot on many projects since and it wouldn't be my first choice. It tends to be selected for its popularity which means there are StackOverflow answers, pretty good support for common use cases, and a large pool to hire from.<p>At the same time, Spring Boot (or even just Spring) aren't the worst once you get used to them. I myself have come to dislike other aspects of it (e.g. slow startup, JPQL and Hibernate quirks, excessive gc, poor scaling). Most of these things probably won't have much of an impact until the application gets to a certain level of complexity or scale. But if it wasn't about solving for the future, Ruby or Python would be better to start.",

Learning to setup a Windows machine for Java development is difficult if you aren't familiar with environment variables and the like.<p>Java, like C++, has gotten more and more features/keywords over the years. Frameworks like Spring Boot tend to make use of those features. Also, Spring Boot is a sit down and read the guides compared to something like Rails or ExpressJS and the like. Depending on your Java knowledge the documentation is going to be hit or miss I think. Also, convention over configuration makes it harder for new developers to get the hang of developing with a framework like Spring Boot because they don't know the conventions usually."

        "Anaxagoras, who lived in the fifth century B.C., was one of the first people in recorded history to recognize that the moon was a rocky, mountainous body. Eduard Lebiedzki / Public Domain Close to the north pole of the moon lies the crater Anaxagoras, named for a Greek philosopher who lived in the fifth century B.C. The eponym is fitting, as Anaxagoras the man was one of the first people in history to suggest the moon was a rocky body, not all too dissimilar from Earth. Streaks of material thrown out during the impact that formed the crater extend 560 miles southward to the rim of another crater, this one named for Plato. Like Plato, Anaxagoras the scholar did most of his work in Athens, but the similarities between the two men stop there. Influenced strongly by the Pythagoreans, Plato posited a mystical universe based on sacred geometric forms, including perfectly circular orbits. Plato eschewed observation and experimentation, preferring to pursue a pure knowledge he believed was innate in all humans. But Anaxagoras, who died around the time Plato was born, had a knack for astronomy, an area of study that requires careful observational and calculation to unlock the mysteries of the universe. During his time in Athens, Anaxagoras made several fundamental discoveries about the moon. He reiterated and expended upon an idea that likely emerged among his predecessors but was not widely accepted in antiquity: that the moon and sun were not gods, but rather objects. This seemingly innocuous belief would ultimately result in Anaxagoras arrest and exile. Anaxagoras crater near the north pole of the moon, imaged by the Lunar Orbiter 4 spacecraft in 1967. NASA Piecing together the lives of early philosophers such as Anaxagoras, who is thought to have written just one book, lost to us today, can be a major challenge for historians. Modern scholars have only fragments to describe the life of Anaxagorasbrief quotes from his teachings and short summaries of his ideas, cited within the works of scholars from later generations, such as Plato and Aristotle. Through persistent observation, Anaxagoras came to believe that the moon was a rock, not totally unlike the Earth, and he even described mountains on the lunar surface. The sun, he thought, was a burning rock. In fragment 18, Anaxagoras says, It is the sun that puts brightness into the moon. While Anaxagoras was not the first to realize that moonlight is reflected light from the sun, he was able to use this concept to correctly explain additional natural phenomena, such as eclipses and lunar phases. Hailing from Clazomenae in the Ionian lands east of the Greek mainland, Anaxagoras grew up during the Ionian Enlightenment, an intellectual revolution that began around 600 B.C. As a young man, he saw Athens and Sparta align to drive the Persian Empire out of Ionia. When he relocated to Athens, Anaxagoras and his contemporaries brought philosophy to the budding Athenian democracy. Although many Greek philosophers of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. believed in one or a few fundamental elementssuch as water, air, fire and earthAnaxagoras thought there must be an infinite number of elements. This idea was his way of resolving an intellectual dispute concerning the nature of existence that had emerged between the naturalistic-minded philosophers of Ionia to the east and the mystical-minded philosophers to the west, in Greek-colonized Italy, such as Pythagoras and his followers. Daniel Graham, a professor of philosophy at Brigham Young University and one of the few Anaxagoras experts in the world, says that of the Italian-based philosophers, Parmenides in particular influenced Anaxagoras and his ideas about astronomy. Anaxagoras turns the problem of lunar light into a problem of geometry, Graham says. He noted that when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth than the sun, the full face is illuminated, [producing] a model of the heavens that predicts not only phases of the moon, but how eclipses are possible. The moons phases, Anaxagoras realized, were the result of different portions of the celestial object being illuminated by the sun from Earths perspective. The philosopher also realized that the occasional darkening of the moon must result from the moon, sun and Earth lining up such that the moon passes into the Earths shadowa lunar eclipse. When the moon passes directly in front of the sun, the skies darken during the day, a phenomenon Anaxagoras also described and we now call a solar eclipse. The total lunar eclipse of October 8, 2014, as photographed from California. When the shadow of the Earth covers the moon, only light filtered through Earth's atmosphere reaches the lunar surface, casting the moon in a reddish glow. Alfredo Garcia, Jr. / Flickr under CC BY-SA 2.0 Anaxagoras also wrestled with the origins and formation of the moon, a mystery that still challenges scientists today. The philosopher proposed that the moon was a big rock which the early Earth had flung into space. This concept anticipated a scenario for the moons origin that physicist George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, would propose 23 centuries later. Known as the fission hypothesis, Darwins idea was that the moon began as a chunk of Earth and was hurled into space by the Earths rapid rotation, leaving behind the Pacific basin. (Today, many astronomers believe that a Mars-sized body slammed into the early Earth, expelling material that then coalesced into the moon, though other theories exist for the origin of our natural satellite.) By describing the moon as a rock of terrestrial origin, and the sun as a burning rock, Anaxagoras moved beyond earlier thinkers, even those who realized the moon was a kind of reflector. This forward thinking got Anaxagoras labeled as a chief denier of the idea that the moon and sun were deities. Such an idea should have been welcome in democratic Athens, but Anaxagoras was a teacher and friend of the influential statesman Pericles, and political factions would soon conspire against him. In power for over 30 years, Pericles would lead Athens into the Peloponnesian wars against Sparta. While the exact causes of these conflicts are a matter of debate, Pericles political opponents in the years leading to the wars blamed him for excessive aggression and arrogance. Unable to hurt the Athenian leader directly, Pericles enemies went after his friends. Anaxagoras was arrested, tried and sentenced to death, ostensibly for breaking impiety laws while promoting his ideas about the moon and sun. In the Athenian democracy, with its democratic trials before large juries on criminal charges being brought by private citizensthere was no district attorneyall trials were basically political trials, Graham says. They were often disguised as being about religion or morality, but they aimed at embarrassing some public figure by going after him directly if he was vulnerable, or a member of his circle if he was not. If you wanted to attack Pericles, but he was too popular to attack directly, you found the weakest link in his group. As a foreigner and intellectual with unorthodox new ideas, Pericles friend and science advisor Anaxagoras was an obvious target. Still holding some political sway, Pericles was able to free Anaxagoras and prevent his execution. Though his life was spared, the philosopher who questioned the divinity of the moon found himself in exile in Lampsacus at the edge of the Hellespont. But his ideas regarding eclipses and lunar phases would live on to this day, and for his recognition of the true nature of the moon, a lunar crater, visited by orbiting spacecraft some 2,400 years later, bears the name Anaxagoras.

        "Something about IR Optimization",
        "https://brrt-to-the-future.blogspot.com/2019/03/something-about-ir-optimization.html",
        "Hi hackers! Today I want to write about optimizing IR in the MoarVM JIT, and also a little bit about IR design itself. One of the (major) design goals for the expression JIT was to have the ability to optimize code over the boundaries of individual MoarVM instructions. To enable this, the expression JIT first expands each VM instruction into a graph of lower-level operators. Optimization then means pattern-matching those graphs and replacing them with more efficient expressions. As a running example, consider the idx operator. This operator takes two inputs (base and element) and a constant parameter scale and computes base+element*scale. This represents one of the operands of an 'indexed load' instruction on x86, typically used to process arrays. Such instructions allow one instruction to be used for what would otherwise be two operations (computing an address and loading a value). However, if the element of the idx operator is a constant, we can replace it instead with the addr instruction, which just adds a constant to a pointer. This is an improvement over idx because we no longer need to load the value of element into a register. This saves both an instruction and valuable register space. Unfortunately this optimization introduces a bug. (Or, depending on your point of view, brings an existing bug out into the open). The expression JIT code generation process selects instructions for subtrees (tile) of the graph in a bottom-up fashion. These instructions represent the value computed or work performed by that subgraph. (For instance, a tree like(load (addr ? 8) 8) becomes mov ?, qword [?+8]; the question marks are filled in during register allocation). Because an instruction is always represents a tree, and because the graph is an arbitrary directed acyclic graph, the code generator projects that graph as a tree by visiting each operator node only once. So each value is computed once, and that computed value is reused by all later references. It is worth going into some detail into why the expression graph is not a tree. Aside from transformations that might be introduced by optimizations (e.g. common subexpression elimination), a template may introduce a value that has multiple references via the let: pseudo-operator. See for instance the following (simplified) template: (let: (($foo (load (local)))) (add $foo (sub $foo (const 1)))) Both ADD and SUB refer to the same LOAD node In this case, both references to $foo point directly to the sameload operator. Thus, the graph is not a tree. Another case in which this occurs is during linking of templates into the graph. The output of an instruction is used, if possible, directly as the input for another instruction. (This is the primary way that the expression JIT can get rid of unnecessary memory operations). But there can be multiple instructions that use a value, in which case an operator can have multiple references. Finally, instruction operands are inserted by the compiler and these can have multiple references as well. If each operator is visited only once during code generation, then this may introduce a problem when combined with another feature - conditional expressions. For instance, if two branches of a conditional expression both refer to the same value (represented by name $foo) then the code generator will only emit code to compute its value when it encounters the firstreference. When the code generator encounters $foo for the second time in the other branch, no code will be emitted.This means that in the second branch, $foo will effectively have no defined value (because the code in the first branch is never executed), and wrong values or memory corruption is then the predictable result. This bug has always existed for as long as the expression JIT has been under development, and in the past the solution has been not to write templates which have this problem. This is made a little easier by a feature the let: operator, in that it inserts a do operator which orders the values that are declared to be computed before the code that references them. So that this is in fact non-buggy: (let: (($foo (load (local))) # code to compute $foo is emitted here (if (...) (add $foo (const 1)) # $foo is just a reference (sub $foo (const 2)) # and here as well The DO node is inserted for the LET operator. It ensures that the value of the LOAD node is computed before the reference in either branch Alternatively, if a value $foo is used in the condition of the if operator, you can also be sure that it is available in both sides of the condition. All these methods rely on the programmer being able to predict when a value will be first referenced and hence evaluated. An optimizer breaks this by design. This means that if I want the JIT optimizer to be successful, my options are: Fix the optimizer so as to not remove references that are critical for the correctness of the program Modify the input tree so that such references are either copied or moved forward Fix the code generator to emit code for a value, if it determines that an earlier reference is not available from the current block. In other words, I first need to decide where this bug really belongs - in the optimizer, the code generator, or even the IR structure itself. The weakness of the expression IR is that expressions don't really impose a particular order. (This is unlike the spesh IR, which is instruction-based, and in which every instruction has a 'previous' and 'next' pointer). Thus, there really isn't a 'first' reference to a value, before the code generator introduces the concept. This is property is in fact quite handy for optimization (for instance, we can evaluate operands in whatever order is best, rather than being fixed by the input order) - so I'd really like to preserve it. But it also means that the property we're interested in - a value is computed before it is used in, in all possible code flow paths - isn't really expressible by the IR. And there is no obvious local invariantthat can be maintained to ensure that this bug does not happen, so any correctness check may have to check the entire graph, which is quite impractical. I hope this post explains why this is such a tricky problem! I have some ideas for how to get out of this, but I'll reserve those for a later post, since this one has gotten quite long enough. Until next time! ",
        "Every JIT that starts out by generating code directly from expression trees or bytecode eventually grows an ad-hoc optimizer and IR. I think its probably better to avoid all the dead ends and lower directly to an SSA IR. You can then implement tried-and-true optimizations from compiler textbooks, and concerns such as \"optimizing across expression boundaries\" or \"my expression tree is actually a DAG\" are defined away completely.",
        "Just a note that this IR sounds a lot like the Testarossa Trees IR: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/omr/blob/master/doc/compiler/il/IntroToTrees.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/eclipse/omr/blob/master/doc/compiler/il/I...</a><p>In that IR the rule is that sharing cannot pass basic-block boundaries because of the exact kind of bug you indicate."

These were some of my favorite datasets in the project - the Moon is our closest celestial neighbor, and we know a lot more about the Moon than about our neighboring planets. The Apollo missions even returned several hundred kilograms of lunar rock to the Earth for detailed analysis. The moon is tidally locked to the Earth, which means that it completes one rotation around its axis in exactly the same time that it takes to circle around the Earth. Because of this, the far side of the moon is never visible from the Earths surface. This topographic map shows the near side of the moon in the large central map, as well as the North pole, South pole, far side, and interior in the four surrounding maps. People have been fascinated by the moon for thousands of years, and lunar events like the full moon or an eclipse are tied to ancient calendars, myths, and celebrations.

        "Advisory ID: NFLX-2019-002 Title: HTTP/2 Denial of Service Advisory Release Date: 2019-08-13 Severity: High Overview: Netflix has discovered several resource exhaustion vectors affecting a variety of third-party HTTP/2 implementations. These attack vectors can be used to launch DoS attacks against servers that support HTTP/2 communication. Netflix worked with Google and CERT/CC to coordinate disclosure to the Internet community. Today, a number of vendors have announced patches to correct this suboptimal behavior. While we havent detected these vulnerabilities in our open source packages, we are issuing this security advisory to document our findings and to further assist the Internet security community in remediating these issues. Impact: There are three broad areas of information security: confidentiality (information cant be read by unauthorized people), integrity (information cant be changed by unauthorized people), and availability (information and systems are available when you want them). All of the changes announced today are in the availability category. These HTTP/2 vulnerabilities do not allow an attacker to leak or modify information. Rather, they allow a small number of low bandwidth malicious sessions to prevent connection participants from doing additional work. These attacks are likely to exhaust resources such that other connections or processes on the same machine may also be impacted or crash. The Weaknesses: HTTP/2 (defined in RFCs 7540 and 7541) represents a significant change from HTTP/1.1. There are several new capabilities, including header compression and multiplexing of data from multiple streams, which make this attractive to the user community. To support these new features, HTTP/2 has grown to encompass some of the complexity of a Layer 3 transport protocol: Data is now carried in binary frames; There are both per-connection and per-stream windows that define how much data can be sent; There are several ICMP-like control messages (ping, reset, and settings frames, for example) which operate at the HTTP/2 connection layer; and, This is a fairly robust concept of stream prioritization. While this added complexity enables some exciting new features, it also raises implementation questions. When implementations run on the internet and are exposed to malicious users, implementers may wonder: Should I limit any of the control messages? How do I implement the priority queueing scheme in a computationally efficient way? How do I implement the flow-control algorithms in a computationally efficient way? How could an attacker manipulate the flow-control algorithm at the HTTP/2 layer to cause unintended results? (And, can they manipulate the flow-control algorithms at both the HTTP/2 and TCP layers together to cause unintended results?) The Security Considerations section of RFC 7540 (see Section 10.5) addresses some of this in a general way. However, unlike the expected normal behaviorwhich is well-documented and which implementations seem to follow very closelythe algorithms and mechanisms for detecting and mitigating abnormal behavior are significantly more vague and left as an exercise for the implementer. From a review of various software packages, it appears that this has led to a variety of implementations with a variety of good ideas, but also some weaknesses. Why does this matter? Most of these attacks work at the HTTP/2 transport layer. As illustrated in the diagram below, this layer sits above the TLS transport, but below the concept of a request. In fact, many of these attacks involve either 0 or 1 requests. Since the early days of HTTP, tooling has been oriented around requests: logs often indicate requests (rather than connections); rate-limiting may occur at the request level; and, traffic controls may be triggered by requests. By contrast, there is not as much tooling that looks at HTTP/2 connections to log, rate-limit, and trigger remediation based on a clients behavior at the HTTP/2 connection layer. Therefore, organizations may find it more difficult to discover and block malicious HTTP/2 connections and may need to add additional tooling to handle these situations. These attack vectors allow a remote attacker to consume excessive system resources. Some are efficient enough that a single end-system could potentially cause havoc on multiple servers. Other attacks are less efficient; however, even less efficient attacks can open the door for DDoS attacks which are difficult to detect and block. Attacks Many of the attack vectors we found (and which were fixed today) are variants on a theme: a malicious client asks the server to do something which generates a response, but the client refuses to read the response. This exercises the servers queue management code. Depending on how the server handles its queues, the client can force it to consume excess memory and CPU while processing its requests. These are the attacks which are being disclosed today, all discovered by Jonathan Looney of Netflix, except for CVE-2019-9518 which was discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google: CVE-2019-9511 Data Dribble: The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9512 Ping Flood: The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9513 Resource Loop: The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9514 Reset Flood: The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9515 Settings Flood: The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9516 0-Length Headers Leak: The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9517 Internal Data Buffering: The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service. CVE-2019-9518 Empty Frames Flood: The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. (Discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google) Workarounds and Fixes In most cases, an immediate workaround is to disable HTTP/2 support. However, this may cause performance degradation, and it might not be possible in all cases. To obtain software fixes, please contact your software vendor.

When I tried to observe it again mid June, it didn't meet the predicted time and path. It turned out to have maneuvered to another orbit. Thanks to the amateur satellite observers-network, it was rapidly found in orbit again and I was able to take some images on June 30 and July 2. This most recent pass was almost overhead. The OTV is a small version of the classic Space Shuttle, it is really a small object, even at only 300 km altitude, so don't expect the detail level of ground based images of the real Space Shuttle. Considering this, the attached images succeeded beyond expectations. We can recognize a bit of the nose, Payload Bay and tail of this mini-shuttle with even a sign of some smaller detail. Images were taken through a 10 inch F/4,8 aperture Newtonian telescope with an Astrolumina ALccd 5L-11 mono CMOS camera. Tracking was fully manually through a 6x30 finderscope.

        "What I find most amazing about this isn't the image (although it's pretty cool), it's the fact that a bunch of amateur astronomers[1] can locate a satellite in space with no help- even after the satellite makes an unannounced move.  The US government literally spends billions of dollars to track things in outer space, and a bunch of amateurs can do basically the same thing.  Granted, Space Fence tracks more and smaller objects, but the amateurs are winning on the price/performance ratio.<p>To clear things up- ephemeris (orbit parameters) are published for many satellites, but not for the X-37B.  It had to be found by some educated guesses and a lot of staring at the sky.<p>[1] To be fair, some \"amateur\" astronomers use very high end equipment.",

        "https://phys.org/news/2019-03-sun-magnetic-field-ten-stronger.html",
        "Credit: Queens University Belfast The sun's magnetic field is ten times stronger than previously believed, new research from Queen's University Belfast and Aberystwyth University has revealed. The new finding was discovered by Dr. David Kuridze, Research Fellow at Aberystwyth University. Dr. Kuridze began the research when he was based at Queen's University Belfast and completed it when he moved to Aberystwyth University in 2017. He is a leading authority on the use of ground-based telescopes to study the sun's corona, the ring of bright light visible during a total eclipse. Working from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma in the Canary Islands, Dr. Kuridze studied a particularly strong solar flare which erupted near the surface of the sun on 10 September 2017. A combination of favourable conditions and an element of luck enabled the team to determine the strength of the flare's magnetic field with unprecedented accuracy. The researchers believe the findings have the potential to change our understanding of the processes that happen in the sun's immediate atmosphere. Speaking about the find, Dr. Kuridze said: \"Everything that happens in the sun's outer atmosphere is dominated by the magnetic field, but we have very few measurements of its strength and spatial characteristics. \"These are critical parameters, the most important for the physics of the solar corona. It is a little like trying to understand the Earth's climate without being able to measure its temperature at various geographical locations. \"This is the first time we have been able to measure accurately the magnetic field of the coronal loops, the building blocks of the sun's magnetic corona, which such a level of accuracy.\" Measuring 1,400,000 kilometres across (109 times larger than Earth) and 150,000,000 kilometres from Earth, the sun's corona extends millions of kilometres above the surface. Solar flares appear as bright flashes and occur when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Until now, successful measurement of the magnetic field has been hindered by the weakness of the signal from the sun's atmosphere that reaches Earth and caries information about the magnetic field, and limitations in the instrumentation available. The magnetic fields reported in this study are similar to those of a typical fridge magnet and around 100 times weaker than the magnetic field encountered in an MRI scanner. However, they are still responsible for the confinement of the solar plasma, which make up solar flares, as far as 20,000 km above the sun's surface. Over a 10-day period in September 2017, Dr. Kuridze studied an active area on the sun's surface which the team knew to be particularly volatile. However, the telescope used can only focus on 1% of the sun's surface at any given time. As luck would have it, Dr. Kuridze was focused on exactly the right area and at the right time when the solar flare erupted. These solar flares can lead to storms which, if they hit Earth, form the northern lights the Aurora Borealis. They can also disrupt communications satellites and GPS systems, as proved to be the case on this occasion in September 2017. Professor Michail Mathioudakis from the School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast, who also worked on the project, added: \"This is a unique set of observations that, for the first time, provide a detailed map of the magnetic field in coronal loops. \"This highly rewarding result was achieved due to the dedication and perseverance of our early career scientists who planned and executed the observations. The methodology used in this work and the result itself, will open new avenues in the study of the solar corona.\" More information: D. Kuridze et al.

        "How Do Developers Promote Open Source Projects?",
        "https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04219",
        "Download PDF Abstract: Open source projects have an increasing importance on modern software development. For this reason, these projects, as usual with commercial software projects, should make use of promotion channels to communicate and establish contact with users and contributors. In this article, we study the channels used to promote a set of 100 popular GitHub projects. First, we reveal that Twitter, user meetings, and blogs are the most common promotion channels used by the studied projects. Second, we report a major difference between the studied projects and a random sample of projects, regarding the use of the investigated promotion channels. Third, we show the importance of a popular news aggregation site (Hacker News) on the promotion of open source. We conclude by presenting a set of practical recommendation to open source project managers and leaders, regarding the promotion of their projects.

        "I'm a little worried that this only studies channels and not the original content itself. I've personally used most of these channels and have found a rather \"bucket-of-crabs\" sort of reaction, unless I'm very, very careful to release an absolutely perfect post.<p>There generally seems to be only a level of tolerance for projects released by big companies. If you have a FANG coolant behind your name, it doesn't matter what you're releasing, how long you've been working on it, or even how big your team actually is, you'll grab a ton of popularity.<p>But as a solo dev releasing under my own name, the only things I can get attention for are basically hacks in niche topics. The long-standing, well designed work I do, that is used in real projects, with tons of documentation and proven results, at best gets ignored. At worst, I get accused of \"re-inventing the wheel\", even for things <i>I</i> invented.<p>I've never gotten anyone to join me on a project. There are a lot of self-fulfilling prophecies that \"solo-dev work won't be around in a year, so don't bother even starting\". Either I release too early and people don't want to join because nothing is finished, or I put a ton of effort into documentation and contribution guidelines and then things just get ignored. Just when is it a good time to go from code I've written on my own to sharing with others?<p>It just really makes it seem like FOSS is only for people who have a big, recognised company backing them. I've even had a project or two copied by recognized companies, with no larger team than one or two people, and watched their half-baked early releases quickly eclipse my own efforts just because they could get people to join the effort and work for free.",
        "A very useful article, thank you for sharing.<p>This is definitely a hard problem for solo developers who are like me and have significant difficulty with social aspects. I've never submitted any of my projects or writing here, because I have this underlying feeling that I'd be bothering people. It also doesn't help to be on a site filled daily with dozens of really incredible projects that feel so much more deserving of attention. Yet I've often found myself bewildered by concepts such as SEO and promotion, and I much prefer to spend my time coding. I hate to generalize, but I can't imagine I'm particularly unique in this regard.<p>But indeed, it's a serious growth limiter when we are stuck working alone. I feel like any serious open source project really needs someone on the team who groks all the social stuff and can get the word out to the right parties who would be interested. A networking service to connect these two types of people would truly be invaluable, I feel.<p>I was also told that technical writing helps a lot, and indeed, despite being a little guy in a small niche, two of my articles were submitted by others recently, and seeing such a positive response has been a huge boost to my self-esteem and confidence. (It did ruin my bounce rate stats though, went from 44% to 87% in two days :p)<p>But yeah, I'll agree with the arXiv conclusion that HN is an incredibly valuable resource for open source developers, with a very friendly community behind it."
