        "February 2, 2019 12:10 PM Developing technology is far more expansive than just writing code. Technology teams need to consider a number of different aspects of the companys technology stack, including its compute infrastructure, storage, development pipeline, security, and more. Companies often purchase various third-party products to complete their technology stack so they dont have to build it all on their own. Each of these tools comes with some form of management console or dashboard that enables companies to tailor that specific tool to the their own needs as well as integrate it within their product. The onboarding, configuration, and ongoing management will likely occur directly from within that console. In fact, managing these third-party products and dashboards actually becomes a significant portion of a technology teams workload and today often falls under the responsibility of the DevOps team. Above: Dashboard overdose: IT organisations are bombarded by dashboards across their entire tech stack To increase automation and efficiency, some companies now are bypassing dashboards and instead preferring to manage these products directly from within their code base. These products are then deployed and configured not as another management console, but rather by developers, as code, in the companys Git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). This trend has been coined GitOps or Git Centric, as increasingly products are being codified and deployed within Git environments. In a somewhat unusual twist of events, Git has become the tool that software companies use to manage their entire technology stack. This means they are deploying their infrastructure, security, and the automation of their development pipeline all from within their Git. Technology blog Dzone put it nicely: Increasingly, companies are using Git as their single source of truth for their code, configurations and infrastructure. All their business logic lives in Git, and automated processes can turn their Git repositories into built and deployed software Weve entered the world of GitOps. A great example of a Git Centric tool is Terraform by Hashicorp. Terraform allows developers to define their infrastructure as code within their Git environment and to consistently and automatically spin up servers with a consistent set of configurations in a scalable manner. It also helps teams of developers understand the underlying server configurations by simply looking at the code rather than having to enter their cloud providers dashboard. The GitOps market is growing exceptionally fast, with companies announcing the codification of their products on a daily basis. At the same time, it is giving developers a perhaps unconsidered and threatening gateway into their production environments. So well also see tools likeDatree.iothat provide automatic policy compliance checks for every code commit. (Disclosure: Datree.io is one of my firms investments). Other tools are emerging to allow GitOps manage and automate more than application deployments. For example, Gitpitch enables teams to build, edit, change, and publish slide presentations. In other words, developers can build entire slide decks and presentations from within their Git provider. They can then manage changes to these presentations and collaborate around them just as they would over their application code base. And theres Waffle.io, a project management tool built within Git for engineering teams. By operating from within Git, Waffle can automatically determine what features and tasks developers have been completed and what is still in progress. It can then automatically communicate status updates to the rest of the team so that everyone is on the same page. I believe Git is likely to become the de-facto tool for automating many company operations. Obviously, the first use cases are focused on the deployment and configuration of applications. But it can also be used effectively for other business processes. The image at the top of this story shows the beginnings of a GitOps landscape.

        "[Update Aug 26, 2020] All hg repos have now been disabled and cannot be accessed.[Update July 1, 2020] Today, mercurial repositories, snippets, and wikis will turn to read-only mode. After July 8th, 2020 they will no longer be accessible. The version control software market has evolved a lot since Bitbucket began in 2008. When we launched, centralized version control was the norm and we only supported Mercurial repos. But Git adoption has grown over the years to become the default system, helping teams of all sizes work faster as they become more distributed.As we surpass 10 million registered users on the platform, we're at a point in our growth where we are conducting a deeper evaluation of the market and how we can best support our users going forward. After much consideration, we've decided to remove Mercurial support from Bitbucket Cloud and its API. Mercurial features and repositories will be officially deprecated on July 1, 2020.Read on to learn more about this decision, the important timelines, and get migration resources and support. The timeline and how this may affect your team Here are the key dates as we sunset Mercurial functionality: February 1, 2020: users will no longer be able to create new Mercurial repositories [Extended] July 1, 2020: users will not be able to use Mercurial features. All hg repos, wikis, and snippets will be in read-only mode. Heres why were focusing on Git This wasnt an easy decision, and Mercurial will always have a special place in Bitbuckets history. DevOps adoption has skyrocketed over the last decade and our customers are adopting this new way of working at an exponential rate. In this time, Bitbucket has steadily grown from being just a version control management tool to being a place to manage the entire software development lifecycle. And there's always more work to be done. This year we will concentrate on building deeper integrations to enhance automation and collaboration. Our improvements will make it even easier and safer to plan, code, test, and deploy all from within Bitbucket. Building quality features requires intense focus, and supporting two version control systems means splitting focus doubling shipping time and technical overhead. With Git being the more popularly used tool, Mercurial runs the risk of overlooked issues as we scale. According to a Stack Overflow Developer Survey, almost 90% of developers use Git, while Mercurial is the least popular version control system with only about 3% developer adoption. In fact, Mercurial usage on Bitbucket is steadily declining, and the percentage of new Bitbucket users choosing Mercurial has fallen to less than 1%. This deprecation will enable us to focus on building the best possible experience for our users. How to migrate and export We recommend that teams migrate their existing Mercurial repos to Git. There are various Git conversion tools in the market, including hg-fast-export and hg-git mercurial plugin. We are happy to support your migration, and you can find a discussion about available options in our dedicated Community thread. If you prefer to continue using the Mercurial system, there are a number of free and paid Mercurial hosting services. We realize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. That's why we've created the following resources to best equip you with the knowledge and tools for a seamless transition: A Community thread to discuss conversion tools, migration, tips, and offer troubleshooting help A Git tutorial that covers anywhere from the basics of creating pull requests to rebasing and Git hooks We want to thank all the loyal users who have grown with us over the years. We look forward to this new focus on our roadmap and to introducing exciting new features. ",
        "It's funny to see how the whole world concentrates on this Git thing, while there is a treasure trove called Mercurial.<p>Mercurial was made for humans. It is seriously convenient and productive. Something I cannot say about Git, which more reminds me of an adhoc job.<p>I use both Git and Mercurial on daily basis. But my preference goes to Mercurial: it is just more sane in a big way. It is clearly a piece of art and love.",
        "It's very sad to see bitbucket dropping mercurial support. Now only Facebook and volunteers are keeping mercurial alive. \nSometimes technically better architecture and user interface lose to a non user friendly hard solutions due to inertia of mass adoption.<p>So a lesson in Software development is similar to betamax and VHS, so marketing is still a winner over technically superior architecture and ease of use. GitHub successfully marketed git, so git and GitHub are synonymous for most developers. Now majority of open source projects are reliant on a single proprietary solution Github by Microsoft, for managing code and project. Can understand the difficulty of bitbucket, when Python language itself moved out of mercurial due to the same inertia.<p>Hopefully gitlab can come out with mercurial support to migrate projects using it from bitbucket.<p>For people who believe in self hosted solution can install Kallithea (<a href=\"https://kallithea-scm.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kallithea-scm.org</a>) or Rhodecode open source edition. Kallithea is used by Unity engine to manage their source code internally with mercurial."

        "Guest post by AWS Community Hero Shimon Tolts, CTO and co-founder at Datree.io. He specializes in developer tools and infrastructure, running a company that is 100% serverless. In recent years, there was a major transition in the way you build and ship software. This was mainly around microservices, splitting code into small components, using infrastructure as code, and using Git as the single source of truth that glues it all together. In this post, I discuss the transition and the different steps of modern software development to showcase the possible solutions for the serverless world. In addition, I list useful tools that were designed for this era. What is serverless? Before I dive into the wonderful world of serverless development and tooling, heres what I mean by serverless. The AWS website talks about four main benefits: No server management. Flexible scaling. Pay for value. Automated high availability. To me, serverless is any infrastructure that you dont have to manage and scale yourself. At my company Datree.io, we run 95% of our workload on AWS Fargate and 5% on AWS Lambda. We are a serverless company; we have zero Amazon EC2 instances in our AWS account. For more information, see the following: Datree.io case study Migrating to AWS ECS Fargate in production CON320: Operational Excellence w/ Containerized Workloads Using AWS Fargate (re:Invent 2018) What is GitOps? Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. According to Luis Faceira, a CI/CD consultant, GitOps is a way of working. You might look at it as an approach in which everything starts and ends with Git. Here are some key concepts: Git as the SINGLE source of truth of a system Git as the SINGLE place where we operate (create, change and destroy) ALL environments ALL changes are observable/verifiable. How you built software before the cloud Back in the waterfall pre-cloud era, you used to have separate teams for development, testing, security, operations, monitoring, and so on. Nowadays, in most organizations, there is a transition to full developer autonomy and developers owning the entire production path. The developer is the King or Queen :) Those teams (Ops/Security/IT/etc) used to be gatekeepers to validate and control every developer change. Now they have become more of a satellite unit that drives policy and sets best practices and standards. They are no longer the production bottleneck, so they provide organization-wide platforms and enablement solutions. Everything is codified With the transition into full developer ownership of the entire pipeline, developers automated everything. We have more code than ever, and processes that used to be manual are now described in code. This is a good transition, in my opinion. Here are some of the benefits: Automation: By storing all things as code, everything can be automated, reused, and re-created in moments. Immutable: If anything goes wrong, create it again from the stored configuration. Versioning: Changes can be applied and reverted, and are tracked to a single user who made the change. GitOps: Git has become the single source of truth The second major transition is that now everything is in one place! Git is the place where all of the code is stored and where all operations are initiated. Whether its testing, building, packaging, or releasing, nowadays everything is triggered through pull requests. This is amplified by the codification of everything. Useful tools in the serverless era There are many useful tools in the market, here is a list of ones that were designed for serverless. Code Always store your code in a source control system. In recent years, more and more functions are codified, such as, BI, ops, security, and AI. For new developers, it is not always obvious that they should use source control for some functionality. GitHub AWS CodeCommit GitLab BitBucket Build and test The most common mistake I see is manually configuring build jobs in the GUI. This might be good for a small POC but it is not scalable. You should have your job codified and inside your Git repository. Here are some tools to help with building and testing: AWS CodeBuild CodeFresh GitHub Actions Jenkins-x CircleCI TravisCI Security and governance When working in a serverless way, you end up having many Git repos. The number of code packages can be overwhelming. The demand for unified code standards remains as it was but now it is much harder to enforce it on top of your R&D org. Here are some tools that might help you with the challenge: Snyk Datree PureSec Aqua Protego Bundle and release Building a serverless application is connecting microservices into one unit. For example, you might be using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. Instead of configuring each one separately, you should use a bundler to hold the configuration in one place. That allows for easy versioning and replication of the app for several environments. Here are a couple of bundlers: Serverless Framework AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) Package When working with many different serverless components, you should create small packages of tools to be able to import across different Lambda functions. You can use a language-specific store like npm or RubyGems, or use a more holistic solution. Here are several package artifact stores that allow hosting for multiple programming languages: GitHub Package Registry Jfrog Artifactory Sonatype Nexus Monitor This part is especially tricky when working with serverless applications, as everything is split into small pieces. Its important to use monitoring tools that support this mode of work. Here are some tools that can handle serverless: Rookout Amazon CloudWatch Epsagon Lumigo NewRelic DataDog Summary The serverless era brings many transitions along with it like a codification of the entire pipeline and Git being the single source of truth. This doesnt mean that the same problems that we use to have like security, logging and more disappeared, you should continue addressing them and leveraging tools that enable you to focus on your business.

        "Lol at the image where before microservices, it was a single monolithic application.<p>FaaS has its use cases but this “serverless for every solution” or 100% serverless marketing is annoying and NOT customer centric (Amazon said they were earths most customer centric company).",
        "This post was disappointing when it first ran: I was expecting some content after the basic intro but then it’s just a couple of saved Google searches with no discussion or analysis. It would have been a lot more interesting if they’d discussed anything about the trade offs of the different services or what they liked about a particular combination."

        "NIKA:\\git-revise\\> list (Aug. 6, 2019): Added the \"What git-revise is not\" section. At Mozilla I often end up building my changes in a patch stack, and used git rebase -i1 to make changes to commits in response to review comments etc. Unfortunately, with a repository as large as mozilla-central2, git rebase -i has some downsides: It's slow! Rebase operates directly on the worktree, so it performs a full checkout of each commit in the stack, and frequently refreshes worktree state. On large repositories (especially on NTFS) that can take a long time. It triggers rebuilds! Because rebase touches the file tree, some build systems (like gecko's recursive-make backend) rebuild unnecessarially. It's stateful! If the rebase fails, the repository is in a weird mid-rebase state, and in edge cases I've accidentally dropped commits due to other processes racing on the repository lock. It's clunky! Common tasks (like splitting & rewording commits) require multiple steps and are unintuitive. Naturally, I did the only reasonable thing: Build a brand-new tool. source: xkcd git-revise is a history editing tool designed for the patch-stack workflow. It's fast, non-destructive, and aims to provide a familiar, powerful, and easy to use re-imagining of the patch stack workflow. It's fast I would never claim to be a benchmarking expert 3, but git-revise performs substantially better than rebase for small history editing tasks 4. In a test applying a single-line change to a mozilla-central commit 20 patches up the stack I saw a 15x speed improvement. $ time bash -c 'git commit --fixup=$TARGET; EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash $TARGET~' <snip> real 0m10.733s $ time git revise $TARGET <snip> real 0m0.685s git-revise accomplishes this using an in-memory rebase algorithm operating directly on git's trees, meaning it never has to touch your index or working directory, avoiding expensive disk I/O! It's handy git-revise isn't just a faster git rebase -i, it provides helpful commands, flags, and tools which make common changes faster, and easier: Fixup Fast $ git add . $ git revise HEAD~~ Running git revise $COMMIT directly collects changes staged in the index, and directly applies them to the specified commit. Conflicts are resolved interactively, and a warning will be shown if the final state of the tree is different from what you started with! With an extra -e, you can update the commit message at the same time, and -a will stage your changes, so you don't have to! 5 Split Commits $ git revise -c $COMMIT Select changes to be included in part [1]: diff --git b/file.txt a/file.txt <snip> Apply this hunk to index [y,n,q,a,d,e,?]? Sometimes, a commit needs to be split in two, perhaps because a change ended up in the wrong commit. The --cut flag (and cut interactive command) provides a fast way to split a commit in-place. Running git revise --cut $COMMIT will start a git add -p-style hunk selector, allowing you to pick changes for part 1, and the rest will end up in part 2. No more tinkering around with edit during a rebase to split off that comment you accidentally added to the wrong commit! Interactive Mode git-revise has a git rebase -i-style interactive mode, but with some quality-of-life improvements, on top of being fast: Implicit Base Commit If a base commit isn't provided, --interactive will implicitly locate a safe base commit to start from, walking up from HEAD, and stopping at published & merge commits. Often git revise -i is all you need! The index Todo Staged changes in the index automatically appear in interactive mode, and can be moved around and treated like any other commit in range. No need to turn it into a commit with a dummy name before you pop open interactive mode & squash it into another commit! Bulk Commit Rewording Ever wanted to update a bunch of commit messages at once? Perhaps they're all missing the bug number? Well, git revise -ie has you covered. It'll open a special Interactive Mode where each command is prefixed with a ++, and the full commit message is present after it. Changes made to these commit messages will be applied before executing the TODOs, meaning you can edit them in bulk. I use this constantly to add bug numbers, elaborate on commit details, and add reviewer information to commit messages. ++ pick f5a02a16731a Bug ??? - My commit summary, r=? The full commit message body follows! ++ pick fef1aeddd6fb Bug ??? - Another commit, r=? Another commit's body! Autosquash Support $ git revise --autosquash If you're used to git rebase -i --autosquash, revise works with you. Running git revise --autosquash will automatically reorder and apply fixup commits created with git commit --fixup=$COMMIT and similar tools, and thanks to the implicit base commit, you don't even need to specify it. You can even pass the -i flag if you want to edit the generated todo list before running it. It's non-destructive git-revise doesn't touch either your working directory, or your index. This means that if it's killed while running, your repository won't be changed, and you can't end up in a mid-rebase state while using it. Problems like conflicts are resolved interactively, while the command is running, without changing the actual files you've been working on. And, as no files are touched, git-revise won't trigger any unnecessary rebuilds! What git-revise is not (Section Added: Aug. 6, 2019) git-revise does not aim to be a complete replacement for git rebase -i. It has a specific use-case in mind, namely incremental changes to a patch stack, and excludes features which rebase supports. In my personal workflow, I still reach for git rebase [-i] when I need to rebase my local commits due to new upstream changes, and I imagine there are people with advanced workflows who cannot use git revise. Working directory changes: git-revise does not modify your working directory or index while it's running. This is part of what allows it to be so fast. However, it also means that certain rebase features, such as the edit interactive command, are not possible. This also is why git revise -i does not support removing commits from within a patch series: doing so would require changing the state of your working directory due to the now-missing commit. If you want to drop a commit you can instead move it to the end of the list and mark it as index. The commit will disappear from history, but your index and working directory won't be changed. A quick git reset --hard HEAD will update your index and working directory. These restrictions may change in the future. Features like this have been requested, and it might be useful to allow opting-in to dropping commits on the floor or pausing mid-revise. Merging through renames & copies: git-revise uses a custom merge backend, which doesn't attempt to handle file renames or copies. For changes which need to be merged or rebased through file renames and copies, git rebase is a better option. Complex history rewriting: git rebase supports rebasing complex commits, such as merges. In contrast, git-revise does not currently aim to support these more advanced features of git rebase. Interested? Awesome! git-revise is a MIT-licensed pure-Python 3.6+ package, and can be installed with pip: $ python3 -m pip install --user git-revise You can also check out the source on GitHub, and read the manpage online, or by running man git revise in your terminal.

Operating systems based on the above Ubuntu and Debian versions are also supported on a best effort basis. If the requested PHP version is pre-installed, setup-php switches to it, otherwise it installs the PHP version. PHP Support On all supported OS/Platforms the following PHP versions are supported as per the runner. PHP 5.3 to PHP 8.2 on GitHub-hosted runners. PHP 5.6 to PHP 8.2 on self-hosted runners. PHP Version Stability Release Support Runner Support 5.3 Stable End of life GitHub-hosted 5.4 Stable End of life GitHub-hosted 5.5 Stable End of life GitHub-hosted 5.6 Stable End of life GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 7.0 Stable End of life GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 7.1 Stable End of life GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 7.2 Stable End of life GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 7.3 Stable Security fixes only GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 7.4 Stable Active GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 8.0 Stable Active GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 8.1 Nightly In development GitHub-hosted, self-hosted 8.2 Nightly In development GitHub-hosted, self-hosted Notes: Specifying 8.1 and 8.2 in php-version input installs a nightly build of PHP 8.1.0-dev and PHP 8.2.0-dev respectively. See nightly build setup for more information. To use JIT on PHP 8.0 and above, refer to the JIT configuration section. PHP Extension Support PHP extensions can be set up using the extensions input. It accepts a string in csv-format. On Ubuntu, extensions which are available as a package, available on PECL or a git repository can be set up. - name: Setup PHP with PECL extension uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' extensions: imagick, swoole On Windows, extensions available on PECL which have the DLL binary can be set up. On macOS, extensions available on PECL or a git repository can be set up. On Ubuntu and macOS to compile and install an extension from a git repository follow this guide. Extensions installed along with PHP if specified are enabled. Specific versions of extensions available on PECL can be set up by suffixing the extension's name with the version. This is useful for installing old versions of extensions which support end of life PHP versions. - name: Setup PHP with specific version of PECL extension uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '5.4' extensions: swoole-1.9.3 Pre-release versions extensions available on PECL can be set up by suffixing the extension's name with its state i.e alpha, beta, devel or snapshot. - name: Setup PHP with pre-release PECL extension uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' extensions: xdebug-beta Shared extensions can be disabled by prefixing them with a :. All extensions depending on the specified extension will also be disabled. - name: Setup PHP and disable opcache uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' extensions: :opcache All shared extensions can be disabled by specifying none. When none is specified along with other extensions, it is hoisted to the start of the input. So, all the shared extensions will be disabled first, then rest of the extensions in the input will be processed. Note: This disables all core and third-party shared extensions and thus, can break some tools which need them. So, make sure you add the required extensions after none in the extensions input. - name: Setup PHP without any shared extensions except mbstring uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' extensions: none, mbstring Extension intl can be set up with specific ICU version for PHP 5.6 and above in Ubuntu workflows by suffixing intl with the ICU version. ICU 50.2 and newer versions are supported. Refer to ICU builds for the specific versions supported. - name: Setup PHP with intl uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' extensions: intl-69.1 Extensions loaded by default after setup-php runs can be found on the wiki. These extensions have custom support: cubrid, pdo_cubrid and gearman on Ubuntu. geos on Ubuntu and macOS. blackfire, couchbase, ioncube, oci8, pdo_firebird, pdo_oci, pecl_http, phalcon3 and phalcon4 on all supported OS. By default, extensions which cannot be added or disabled gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the action is not interrupted. To change this behaviour you can set fail-fast flag to true. - name: Setup PHP with fail-fast uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' extensions: oci8 env: fail-fast: true Tools Support These tools can be set up globally using the tools input. It accepts a string in csv-format. behat, blackfire, blackfire-player, codeception, composer, composer-normalize, composer-prefetcher, composer-require-checker, composer-unused, cs2pr, deployer, flex, grpc_php_plugin, infection, parallel-lint, pecl, phan, phing, phinx, phive, php-config, php-cs-fixer, phpcbf, phpcpd, phpcs, phpdoc or phpDocumentor, phpize, phplint, phpmd, phpspec, phpstan, phpunit, phpunit-bridge, phpunit-polyfills, prestissimo, protoc, psalm, symfony or symfony-cli, vapor or vapor-cli, wp or wp-cli - name: Setup PHP with tools uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' tools: php-cs-fixer, phpunit In addition to above tools any composer tool or package can also be set up globally by specifying it as vendor/package matching the listing on Packagist. This format accepts the same version constraints as composer. - name: Setup PHP with tools uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' tools: vimeo/psalm To set up a particular version of a tool, specify it in the form tool:version. Version can be in the following format: Semver. For example tool:1.2.3 or tool:1.2.3-beta1. Major version. For example tool:1 or tool:1.x. Major and minor version. For example tool:1.2 or tool:1.2.x. When you specify just the major version or the version in major.minor format, the latest patch version matching the input will be setup. Except for major versions of composer, For other tools when you specify only the major version or the version in major.minor format for any tool you can get rate limited by GitHub's API. To avoid this, it is recommended to provide a GitHub OAuth token. You can do that by setting COMPOSER_TOKEN environment variable. - name: Setup PHP with tools uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' tools: php-cs-fixer:3, phpunit:8.5 env: COMPOSER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} The latest stable version of composer is set up by default. You can set up the required composer version by specifying the major version v1 or v2, or the version in major.minor or semver format, Additionally for composer snapshot and preview can also be specified to set up the respective releases. - name: Setup PHP with composer v2 uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' tools: composer:v2 If you do not use composer in your workflow, you can specify tools: none to skip it. - name: Setup PHP without composer uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' tools: none Scripts phpize and php-config are set up with the same version as of the input PHP version. The latest version of blackfire cli is set up when blackfire is specified in tools input. Please refer to the official documentation for using blackfire with GitHub Actions. Tools prestissimo and composer-prefetcher will be skipped unless composer:v1 is also specified in tools input. It is recommended to drop prestissimo and use composer v2. By default, tools which cannot be set up gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the action is not interrupted. To change this behaviour you can set fail-fast flag to true. - name: Setup PHP with fail-fast uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' tools: deployer env: fail-fast: true Notes Input tools is useful to set up tools which you only use in GitHub Actions, thus keeping your composer.json tidy. If you do not want to use all your dev-dependencies in GitHub Actions workflow, you can run composer with --no-dev and install required tools using tools input to speed up your workflow. If you have a tool in your composer.json, do not set up it with tools input as the two instances of the tool might conflict. Coverage Support Xdebug Specify coverage: xdebug to use Xdebug and disable PCOV. Runs on all PHP versions supported. - name: Setup PHP with Xdebug uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' coverage: xdebug The latest version of Xdebug compatible with the PHP version is set up by default. If you need Xdebug 2.x on PHP 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, you can specify coverage: xdebug2. - name: Setup PHP with Xdebug 2.x uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '7.4' coverage: xdebug2 PCOV Specify coverage: pcov to use PCOV and disable Xdebug. Runs on PHP 7.1 and newer PHP versions. If your source code directory is other than src, lib or, app, specify pcov.directory using the ini-values input. - name: Setup PHP with PCOV uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' ini-values: pcov.directory=api #optional, see above for usage. coverage: pcov PHPUnit 8.x and above supports PCOV out of the box. If you are using PHPUnit 5.x, 6.x or 7.x, you need to set up pcov/clobber before executing your tests. - name: Setup PCOV run: | composer require pcov/clobber vendor/bin/pcov clobber Disable Coverage Specify coverage: none to disable both Xdebug and PCOV. Disable coverage for these reasons: You are not generating coverage reports while testing. It will disable Xdebug, which will have a positive impact on PHP performance. You are using phpdbg for running your tests. You are profiling your code using blackfire. You are using PHP in JIT mode. Please refer to JIT configuration section for more details. - name: Setup PHP with no coverage driver uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' coverage: none Usage Inputs Specify using with keyword php-version (required) Specify the PHP version you want to set up. Accepts a string. For example '8.0'. Accepts latest to set up the latest stable PHP version. Accepts nightly to set up a nightly build from the master branch of PHP. Accepts the format d.x, where d is the major version. For example 5.x, 7.x and 8.x. See PHP support for supported PHP versions. extensions (optional) Specify the extensions you want to add or disable. Accepts a string in csv-format. For example mbstring, :opcache. Accepts none to disable all shared extensions. Shared extensions prefixed with : are disabled. See PHP extension support for more info. ini-values (optional) Specify the values you want to add to php.ini. Accepts a string in csv-format. For example post_max_size=256M, max_execution_time=180. Accepts ini values with commas if wrapped in quotes. For example xdebug.mode=\"develop,coverage\". coverage (optional) Specify the code-coverage driver you want to set up. Accepts xdebug, pcov or none. See coverage support for more info. tools (optional) Specify the tools you want to set up. Accepts a string in csv-format. For example: phpunit, phpcs See tools Support for tools supported. Outputs php-version To use outputs, give the setup-php step an id, you can use the same to get the outputs in a later step. Provides the PHP version in semver format. - name: Setup PHP id: setup-php uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' - name: Print PHP version run: echo ${{ steps.setup-php.outputs.php-version }} Flags Specify using env keyword fail-fast (optional) Specify to mark the workflow as failed if an extension or tool fails to set up. This changes the default mode from graceful warnings to fail-fast. By default, it is set to false. Accepts true and false. phpts (optional) Specify to set up thread-safe version of PHP on Windows. Accepts ts and nts. By default, it is set to nts. See thread safe setup for more info. update (optional) Specify to update PHP on the runner to the latest patch version. Accepts true and false. By default, it is set to false. See force update setup for more info. See below for more info.

Pre-installed PHP versions on the GitHub Actions images are not updated to their latest patch release by default. You can specify the update environment variable to true for updating to the latest release. - name: Setup PHP with latest versions uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' env: update: true # specify true or false Verbose Setup Debug your workflow To debug any issues, you can use the verbose tag instead of v2. - name: Setup PHP with logs uses: shivammathur/setup-php@verbose with: php-version: '8.0' Multi-Arch Setup Setup PHP on multiple architecture on Ubuntu GitHub Runners. PHP 5.6 to PHP 8.0 are supported by setup-php on multiple architecture on Ubuntu. For this, you can use shivammathur/node images as containers. These have compatible Nodejs installed for JavaScript based GitHub Actions. Currently, for ARM based setup, you will need self-hosted runners. jobs: run: runs-on: ubuntu-latest container: shivammathur/node:latest-${{ matrix.arch }} strategy: matrix: arch: [\"amd64\", \"i386\"] steps: - name: Install PHP uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' Self Hosted Setup Setup PHP on a self-hosted runner. To set up a containerised self-hosted runner, refer to the following guides as per your base operating system. Linux Windows To set up the runner directly on the host OS or in a virtual machine, follow this requirements guide before setting up the self-hosted runner. If your workflow uses service containers, then set up the runner on a Linux host or in a Linux virtual machine. GitHub Actions does not support nested virtualization on Linux, so services will not work in a dockerized container. Specify the environment variable runner with the value self-hosted. Without this your workflow will fail. jobs: run: runs-on: self-hosted strategy: matrix: php-versions: ['5.6', '7.0', '7.1', '7.2', '7.3', '7.4', '8.0'] name: PHP ${{ matrix.php-versions }} steps: - name: Setup PHP uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }} env: runner: self-hosted # Specify the runner. Notes Do not set up multiple self-hosted runners on a single server instance as parallel workflow will conflict with each other. Do not set up self-hosted runners on the side on your development environment or your production server. Avoid using the same labels for your self-hosted runners which are used by GitHub-hosted runners. Local Testing Setup Test your Ubuntu workflow locally using nektos/act. jobs: run: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Setup PHP uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' Run the workflow locally with act using shivammathur/node docker images. Choose the image tag which matches the runs-on property in your workflow. For example, if you are using ubuntu-20.04 in your workflow, run act -P ubuntu-20.04=shivammathur/node:20.04. # For runs-on: ubuntu-latest act -P ubuntu-latest=shivammathur/node:latest # For runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 act -P ubuntu-20.04=shivammathur/node:2004 # For runs-on: ubuntu-18.04 act -P ubuntu-18.04=shivammathur/node:1804 JIT Configuration Enable Just-in-time(JIT) on PHP 8.0 and above. To enable JIT, enable opcache in cli mode by setting opcache.enable_cli=1. JIT conflicts with Xdebug, PCOV, and other extensions which override zend_execute_ex function, so set coverage: none and disable any such extension if added. By default, opcache.jit=1235 and opcache.jit_buffer_size=256M are set which can be changed using ini-values input. For detailed information about JIT related directives refer to the official PHP documentation. For example to enable JIT in tracing mode with buffer size of 64 MB. - name: Setup PHP with JIT in tracing mode uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' coverage: none ini-values: opcache.enable_cli=1, opcache.jit=tracing, opcache.jit_buffer_size=64M Cache Extensions You can cache PHP extensions using shivammathur/cache-extensions and action/cache GitHub Actions. Extensions which take very long to set up when cached are available in the next workflow run and are enabled directly. This reduces the workflow execution time. Refer to shivammathur/cache-extensions for details. Cache Composer Dependencies If your project uses composer, you can persist the composer's internal cache directory. Dependencies cached are loaded directly instead of downloading them while installation. The files cached are available across check-runs and will reduce the workflow execution time. - name: Get composer cache directory id: composer-cache run: echo \"::set-output name=dir::$(composer config cache-files-dir)\" - name: Cache dependencies uses: actions/cache@v2 with: path: ${{ steps.composer-cache.outputs.dir }} key: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.lock') }} restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-composer- - name: Install dependencies run: composer install --prefer-dist Notes Please do not cache vendor directory using action/cache as that will have side effects. If you do not commit composer.lock, you can use the hash of composer.json as the key for your cache. key: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.json') }} If you support a range of composer dependencies and use prefer-lowest and prefer-stable options, you can store them in your matrix and add them to the keys. key: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.lock') }}-${{ matrix.prefer }}- restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ matrix.prefer }}- Composer GitHub OAuth If you have a number of workflows which set up multiple tools or have many composer dependencies, you might hit the GitHub's rate limit for composer. Also, if you specify only the major version or the version in major.minor format, you can hit the rate limit. To avoid this you can specify an OAuth token by setting COMPOSER_TOKEN environment variable. You can use GITHUB_TOKEN secret for this purpose. - name: Setup PHP uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' env: COMPOSER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} Inline PHP Scripts If you have to run multiple lines of PHP code in your workflow, you can do that easily without saving it to a file. Put the code in the run property of a step and specify the shell as php {0}. - name: Setup PHP uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2 with: php-version: '8.0' - name: Run PHP code shell: php {0} run: | <?php $welcome = \"Hello, world\"; echo $welcome; Problem Matchers Problem matchers are json configurations which identify errors and warnings in your logs and surface them prominently in the GitHub Actions UI by highlighting them and creating code annotations.

It is a rolling tag and is synced with the latest minor and patch releases. With v2 you automatically get the bug fixes, security patches, new features and support for latest PHP releases. For debugging any issues verbose tag can be used temporarily. It outputs all the logs and is also synced with the latest releases. Semantic release versions can also be used. It is recommended to use dependabot with semantic versioning to keep the actions in your workflows up to date. Commit SHA can also be used, but are not recommended. They have to be updated with every release manually, without which you will not get any bug fixes, security patches or new features. It is highly discouraged to use the master branch as version, it might break your workflow after major releases as they have breaking changes. If you are using the v1 tag or a 1.x.y version, you should switch to v2 as v1 only gets critical bug fixes. Maintenance support for v1 will be dropped with the last PHP 8.0 release.

        "Introducing Streamlit, an app framework built for ML engineersCoding a semantic search engine with real-time neural-net inference in 300 lines of Python.In my experience, every nontrivial machine learning project is eventually stitched together with bug-ridden and unmaintainable internal tools. These tools often a patchwork of Jupyter Notebooks and Flask apps are difficult to deploy, require reasoning about client-server architecture, and dont integrate well with machine learning constructs like Tensorflow GPU sessions.I saw this first at Carnegie Mellon, then at Berkeley, Google X, and finally while building autonomous robots at Zoox. These tools were often born as little Jupyter notebooks: the sensor calibration tool, the simulation comparison app, the LIDAR alignment app, the scenario replay tool, and so on.As a tool grew in importance, project managers stepped in. Processes sprouted. Requirements flowered. These solo projects gestated into scripts, and matured into gangly maintenance nightmares.The machine learning engineers ad-hoc app building flow.When a tool became crucial, we called in the tools team. They wrote fluent Vue and React. They blinged their laptops with stickers about declarative frameworks. They had a design process:The tools teams clean-slate app building flow.Which was awesome. But these tools all needed new features, like weekly. And the tools team was supporting ten other projects. They would say, well update your tool again in two months.So we were back to building our own tools, deploying Flask apps, writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and trying to version control everything from notebooks to stylesheets. So my old Google X friend, Thiago Teixeira, and I began thinking about the following question: What if we could make building tools as easy as writing Python scripts?We wanted machine learning engineers to be able to create beautiful apps without needing a tools team. These internal tools should arise as a natural byproduct of the ML workflow. Writing such tools should feel like training a neural net or performing an ad-hoc analysis in Jupyter! At the same time, we wanted to preserve all of the flexibility of a powerful app framework. We wanted to create beautiful, performant tools that engineers could show off. Basically, we wanted this:The Streamlit app building flow.With an amazing beta community including engineers from Uber, Twitter, Stitch Fix, and Dropbox, we worked for a year to create Streamlit, a completely free and open source app framework for ML engineers. With each prototype, the core principles of Streamlit became simpler and purer. They are:#1: Embrace Python scripting. Streamlit apps are really just scripts that run from top to bottom. Theres no hidden state. You can factor your code with function calls. If you know how to write Python scripts, you can write Streamlit apps. For example, this is how you write to the screen:import streamlit as stst.write('Hello, world!')Nice to meet you.#2: Treat widgets as variables. There are no callbacks in Streamlit! Every interaction simply reruns the script from top to bottom. This approach leads to really clean code:import streamlit as stx = st.slider('x')st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)An interactive Streamlit app in three lines of code.#3: Reuse data and computation. What if you download lots of data or perform complex computation? The key is to safely reuse information across runs. Streamlit introduces a cache primitive that behaves like a persistent, immutable-by-default, data store that lets Streamlit apps safely and effortlessly reuse information. For example, this code downloads data only once from the Udacity Self-driving car project, yielding a simple, fast app:Using st.cache to persist data across Streamlit runs. To run this code, please follow these instructions.The output of running the st.cache example above.In short, Streamlit works like this:The entire script is run from scratch for each user interaction.Streamlit assigns each variable an up-to-date value given widget states.Caching allows Streamlit to skip redundant data fetches and computation.Or in pictures:User events trigger Streamlit to rerun the script from scratch. Only the cache persists across runs.If this sounds intriguing, you can try it right now! Just run:$ pip install --upgrade streamlit $ streamlit hello You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser. Local URL: http://localhost:8501 Network URL: http://10.0.1.29:8501This will automatically pop open a web browser pointing to your local Streamlit app. If not, just click the link.To see more examples like this fractal animation, run streamlit hello from the command line.Ok. Are you back from playing with fractals? Those can be mesmerizing.The simplicity of these ideas does not prevent you from creating incredibly rich and useful apps with Streamlit. During my time at Zoox and Google X, I watched as self-driving car projects ballooned into gigabytes of visual data, which needed to be searched and understood, including running models on images to compare performance. Every self-driving car project Ive seen eventually has had entire teams working on this tooling.Building such a tool in Streamlit is easy. This Streamlit demo lets you perform semantic search across the entire Udacity self-driving car photo dataset, visualize human-annotated ground truth labels, and run a complete neural net (YOLO) in real time from within the app [1].This 300-line Streamlit demo combines semantic visual search with interactive neural net inference.The whole app is a completely self-contained, 300-line Python script, most of which is machine learning code. In fact, there are only 23 Streamlit calls in the whole app. You can run it yourself right now!$ pip install --upgrade streamlit opencv-python$ streamlit runhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/master/app.pyAs we worked with machine learning teams on their own projects, we came to realize that these simple ideas yield a number of important benefits:Streamlit apps are pure Python files. So you can use your favorite editor and debugger with Streamlit.My favorite layout for writing Streamlit apps has VSCode on the left and Chrome on the right.Pure Python scripts work seamlessly with Git and other source control software, including commits, pull requests, issues, and comments. Because Streamlits underlying language is pure Python, you get all the benefits of these amazing collaboration tools for free .Because Streamlit apps are just Python scripts, you can easily version control them with Git.Streamlit provides an immediate-mode live coding environment. Just click Always rerun when Streamlit detects a source file change.Click Always rerun to enable live coding.Caching simplifies setting up computation pipelines. Amazingly, chaining cached functions automatically creates efficient computation pipelines! Consider this code adapted from our Udacity demo:A simple computation pipeline in Streamlit. To run this code, please follow these instructions.Basically, the pipeline is load_metadata create_summary. Every time the script is run Streamlit only recomputes whatever subset of the pipeline is required to get the right answer. Cool!To make apps performant, Streamlit only recomputes whatever is necessary to update the UI.Streamlit is built for GPUs. Streamlit allows direct access to machine-level primitives like TensorFlow and PyTorch and complements these libraries. For example in this demo, Streamlits cache stores the entire NVIDIA celebrity face GAN [2]. This approach enables nearly instantaneous inference as the user updates sliders.This Streamlit app demonstrates NVIDIA celebrity face GAN [2] model using Shaobo Guans TL-GAN [3].Streamlit is a free and open-source library rather than a proprietary web app. You can serve Streamlit apps on-prem without contacting us. You can even run Streamlit locally on a laptop without an Internet connection! Furthermore, existing projects can adopt Streamlit incrementally.Several ways incrementally adopt Streamlit. (Icons courtesy of fullvector / Freepik.)This just scratches the surface of what you can do with Streamlit. One of the most exciting aspects of Streamlit is how these primitives can be easily composed into complex apps that look like scripts. Theres a lot more we could say about how our architecture works and the features we have planned, but well save that for future posts.Block diagram of Streamlits components. More coming soon!Were excited to finally share Streamlit with the community today and see what you all build with it. We hope that youll find it easy and delightful to turn your Python scripts into beautiful ML apps.Thanks to Amanda Kelly, Thiago Teixeira, TC Ricks, Seth Weidman, Regan Carey, Beverly Treuille, Genevive Wachtell, and Barney Pell for their helpful input on this article.References:[1] J.

You require some more tooling. In this blog post, youll see a broad list of tools that make C++ programming possible: compilers, IDEs, debuggers and other. Last Update: 14th October 2019. Note: This is a blog post based on the White Paper created by Embarcadero, see the full paper here: C++ Ecosystem White Paper. Introduction The C++ computer programming language has become one of the most widely used modern programming languages. Software built with C++ is known for its performance and efficiency. C++ has been used to build numerous vastly popular core libraries, applications such as Microsoft Office, game engines such as Unreal, software tools like Adobe Photoshop, compilers like Clang, databases like MySQL, and even operating systems such as Windows across a wide variety of platforms as it continues to evolve and grow. Modern C++ is generally defined as C++ code that utilizes language features in C++11, C++14, and C++17 based compilers. These are language standards named after the year they were defined (2011, 2014 and 2017 respectively) and include a number of significant additions and enhancements to the original core language for powerful, highly performant, and bug-free code. Modern C++ has high-level features that support object-oriented programming, functional programming, generic programming, and low-level memory manipulation features. Big names in the computer industry such as Microsoft, Intel, the Free Software Foundation, and others have their modern C++ compilers. Companies such as Microsoft, The QT Company, JetBrains, and Embarcadero provide integrated development environments for writing code in modern C++. Popular libraries are available for C++ across a wide range of computer disciplines including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, Math, Scientific Computing, Audio Processing, and Image Processing. In this blog post, we are going to cover a number of these compilers, build tools, IDEs, libraries, frameworks, coding assistants, and much more that can support and enhance your development with modern C++. Lets get started! Compilers There are a number of popular compilers that support modern C++ including GCC/g++, MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++), Clang and Intel Compiler. Each compiler has varying support for each of the major operating systems with the open-source GCC/g++ originating in the late 1980s, Microsofts Visual C++ in the early 1990s, and Clang in the late 2000s. All four compilers support modern C++ up to at least C++17, but the source code licenses for each of them vary greatly. GCC GCC is a general-use compiler developed and maintained and regularly updated by the GCC Steering committee as part of the GNU Project. GCC describes a large growing family of compilers targeting many hardware platforms and several languages. While it mainly targets Unix-like platforms, Windows support is provided through the Cygwin or MinGW runtime libraries. GCC compiles modern C++ code up to C++17 with experimental support for some C++20 features. It also compiles with a variety of language extensions that build upon C++ standards. It is free and open-source (GPL3) with the GCC Runtime Library Exception. GCC has support from build tools such as CMake and Ninja and many IDEs such as CLion, Qt Creator, and Visual Studio Code. https://gcc.gnu.org/ https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html Microsoft Visual C++ Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) is Microsofts compiler for their custom implementation of the C++ standard, known as Visual C++. It is regularly updated, and like GCC and Clang, supports modern C++ standards up to C++17 with experimental support for some C++20 features. MSVC is the primary method for building C++ applications in Microsofts own Visual Studio. It generally targets a number of architectures on Windows, Android, iOS, and Linux. Support for build tools and IDEs are limited but growing. CMake extensions are available in Visual Studio 2019. MSVC can be used with Visual Studio Code, with limited support from CLion and Qt Creator with additional extensions. MSVC is proprietary and available under a commercial license, but theres also a Community edition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ Clang Clang describes a large family of compilers for the C family of languages maintained and regularly developed as part of the LLVM project. Although it targets many popular architectures, it generally targets fewer platforms than GCC. The LLVM project defines Clang through key design principles - strict adherence to C++ standards (although support for GCC extensions is offered), modular design, and minimal modification to the source codes structure during compilation, to name a few. Like GCC, Clang compiles modern C++ code with support for the C++17 standard with experimental C++20 support. It is available under an open-source (Apache License Version 2.0) license. Clang also has widespread support from build tools such as CMake and Ninja and IDEs such as CLion, Qt Creator, Xcode, and others. https://clang.llvm.org/ https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html Intel C++ Compiler Intel C++ Compiler can generate highly optimized code for various Intel CPUs (including Xeon, Core, and Atom processors). The compiler can seamlessly integrate with popular IDE like Visual Studio, GCC toolchain and others. It can leverage advanced instruction set (even AVX512) and generate parallel code (for example, thanks to OpenMP 5.0 support). Intel doesnt ship the compiler with the Standard Library implementation, so it uses the library you provide on your platform. The compiler is available as a part of Intel Parallel Studio XE or Intel System Studio. https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/c17-features-supported-by-intel-c-compiler On top of compilers, you need an infrastructure that helps to build a whole application: build tools, pipelines and package managers. Make Make is a well-known build system widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Make is typically used to build executable programs and libraries from source code. But the tool applies to any process that involves executing arbitrary commands to transform a source file to a target result. Make is not tight to any particular programming language. It automatically determines which source files has been changed and then performs the minimal build process to get the final output. It also helps with the installation of the results in the system https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ Cmake CMake is a cross-platform tool for managing your build process. Building, especially large apps and with dependent libraries, can be a very complex process, especially when you support multiple compilers; CMake abstracts this. You can define complex build processes in one common language and convert them to native build directives for any number of supported compilers, IDEs, and build tools, including Ninja (below.) There are versions of CMake available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. https://cmake.org/ Note: Heres a good answer about the differences between Make and Cmake: Difference between using Makefile and CMake to compile the code - Stack Overflow. Ninja The Ninja build system is used for the actual process of building apps and is similar to Make. It focuses on running as fast as possible by parallelizing builds. It is commonly used paired with CMake, which supports creating build files for the Ninja build system. The feature set of Ninja is intentionally kept minimal because the focus is on speed. https://ninja-build.org/ Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) MSBuild is a command-line based built platform available from Microsoft under an open-source (MIT) license. It can be used to automate the process of compiling and deploying projects. It is available standalone, packaged with Visual Studio, or from Github. The structure and function of MSBuild files is very similar to Make. MSBuild has an XML based file format and mainly has support for Windows but also macOS and Linux. IDEs such as CLion and C++Builder can integrate with MSBuild as well. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild Conan, Vcpkg, Buckaroo Package managers such as Conan, vcpkg, Buckaroo and NIX have been gaining popularity in the C++ community. A package manager is a tool to install libraries or components. Conan is a decentralized open-source (MIT) package manager that supports multiple platforms and all build systems (such as CMake and MSBuild). Conan supports binaries with a goal of automating dependency management to save time in development and continuous integration. Microsofts vcpkg is open source under an MIT license and supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Out of the box, it makes installed libraries available in Visual Studio, but it also supports CMake build recipes. It can build libs for every toolchain that can be fitted into CMake. Buckaroo is a lesser-known open-source package manager that can pull dependencies from GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and others. Buckaroo offers integrations for a number of IDEs including CLion, Visual Studio Code, XCode, and others. Here are the links for the mentioned package managers: https://conan.io/ https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg https://buckaroo.pm/ Integrated Development Environments A host of editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) can be used for developing with modern C++. Text editors are typically lightweight, but are less featureful than a full IDE and so are used only for the process of writing code, not debugging or testing it. Full development requires other tools, and an IDE contains those and integrates into a cohesive, integrated development environment. Any number of text editors like Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code, vi/vim, and Emacs can be used for writing C++ code. However, some IDEs are specifically designed with modern C++ in mind like CLion, Qt Creator, and C++Builder, while IDEs like Xcode and Visual Studio also support other languages. You can also compare various IDE for C++ in this handy table on Wikipedia: Comparison of integrated development environments - C++ - Wikipedia Sublime Text, Atom, And Visual Studio Code The list below summarises a set of advanced source code editors that thanks to various plugins and extensions allow creating applications in almost all programming languages. Sublime Text is a commercial text editor with extended support for modern C++ available via plugins. Atom is an open-source (MIT license) text editor that supports modern C++ via packages with integrations available for debugging and compiling. Visual Studio Code is a popular open-source (MIT license) source-code editor from Microsoft. A wide variety of extensions are available that bring features such as debugging and code completion for modern C++ to Visual Studio Code. Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code are all available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Here are the links for the above tools: https://www.sublimetext.com/ https://atom.io/ https://code.visualstudio.com/ Vi/Vim & Emacs Vi/Vim and Emacs are free command-line based text editors that are mainly used on Linux but are also available for macOS and Windows. Modern C++ support can be added to Vi/Vim through the use of scripts while modern C++ support can be added to Emacs through the use of modules. https://www.vim.org/ https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Clion CLion is a commercial IDE from JetBrains that supports modern C++. It can be used with build tools like CMake and Gradle, integrates with the GDB and LLDB debuggers, can be used with version control systems like Git, test libraries like Boost.Test, and various documentation tools.

The C++ Compiler supports C++14. https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/developerstudio/overview/index.html https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/features/compilers-2332272.html If you want to check some shorter code samples and you dont want to install the whole compiler/.IDE suite then we have lots of online tools that can make those tests super simple. Just open a web browser and put the code Compiler Explorer is a web-based tool that allows you to select from a wide variety of C++ compilers and different versions of the same compiler to test out your code. This allows developers to compare the generated code for specific C++ constructs among compilers, and test for correct behaviour. Clang, GCC, and MSVC are all there but also lesser-known compilers such as DJGPP, ELLCC, Intel C++, and others. https://godbolt.org/ Extra: Heres a list of handy online compilers that you can use: like Coliru, Wandbox, CppInsighs and more: https://arnemertz.github.io/online-compilers/ Debugging & Testing GDB GDB is a portable command-line based debugging platform that supports modern C++ and is available under an open-source license (GPL). A number of editors and IDEs like Visual Studio, Qt Creator, and CLion support integration with GDB. It can also be used to debug applications remotely where GDB is running on one device, and the application being debugged is running on another device. It supports a number of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/ LLDB LLDB is an open-source debugging interface that supports modern C++ and integrates with the Clang compiler. It has a number of optional performance-enhancing features such as JIT but also supports debugging memory, multiple threads, and machine code analysis. It is built in C++. LLDB is the default debugger for Xcode and can be used with Visual Studio Code, CLion, and Qt Creator. It supports a number of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. https://lldb.llvm.org/ Debugging Tools For Windows On Windows, you can use several debuggers, ranging from Visual Studio Debugger (integrated and one of the most user-friendly), WinDBG, CDB and several more. WinDbg is a multipurpose debugger for the Microsoft Windows Platform. It can be used to debug user-mode applications, device drivers, and the operating system itself in kernel mode. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) and is more powerful than Visual Studio Debugger. You can debug memory dumps obtained even from kernel drivers. One of the recent exciting features in Debugging on Windows is called Time Travel Debugging (Available in WinDBG Preview and also in Visual Studio Ultimate). It allows you to record the execution of the process and then replay the steps backwards or forwards. This flexibility enables us to easily tracks back the state that caused a bug. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview Mozillas RR RR is an advanced debugger that aims to replace GDB on Linux. It offers the full state recordings of the application so that you can replay the action backwards and forwards (similarly to Time Travel Debugging). The debugger is used to work with large applications like Chrome, OpenOffice or even Firefox code bases. https://rr-project.org/ CATCH/CATCH2 Catch2 is a cross-platform open-source (BSL-1.0) testing framework for modern C++. It is very lightweight because only a header file needs to be included. Unit tests can be tagged and run in groups. It supports both test-driven development and behaviour-driven development. Catch2 also easily integrates with CLion. https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2 BOOST.TEST Boost.Test is a feature-rich open-source (BSL-1.0) testing framework that utilizes modern C++ standards. It can be used to quickly detect errors, failures, and time outs through customizable logging and real-time monitoring. Tests can be grouped into suites, and the framework supports both small scale testing and large scale testing. https://github.com/boostorg/test GOOGLE TEST Google Test is Googles C++ testing and mocking framework, which is available under an open-source (BSD) license. Google test can be used on a broad range of platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and others. It contains a unit testing framework, assertions, death tests, detects failures, handles parameterized tests, and creates XML test reports. https://github.com/google/googletest CUTE CUTE is a unit testing framework integrated into Cevelop, but it can also be used standalone. It spans C++ versions from c++98 to c++2a and is header-only. While not as popular as Google Test it is less macro-ridden and uses macros only, where no appropriate C++ feature is available. In addition, it features a mode that easily allows it to run on embedded platforms, by sidestepping some of the I/O formatting features. https://cute-test.com/ DocTest DocTest is a single-header unit testing framework. Available for C++11 up to C++20 and is easy to configure and works on probably all platforms. It offers regular TDD testing macros (also with subcases) as well as BDD-style test cases. http://bit.ly/doctest-docs https://github.com/onqtam/doctest Mull Mull is an LLVM-based tool for Mutation Testing with a strong focus on C and C++ languages. In general, it creates many variations of the input source code (using LLVM bytecode) and then checks it against the test cases. Thanks to this advanced testing technique, you can make your code more secure. https://github.com/mull-project/mull PDF: https://lowlevelbits.org/pdfs/Mull_Mutation_2018.pdf Sanitizers AddressSanitizer - https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html (supported in Clang, GCC and XCode) UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer - https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html LeakSanitizer - https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html Application Verifier for Windows - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/application-verifier Sanitizers are relatively new tools that add extra instrumentation to your application (for example they replace new/malloc/delete calls) and can detect various runtime errors: leaks, use after delete, double free and many others. To improve your build pipeline, many guides advice to add sanitizers steps when doing tests. Most sanitizers come from the LLVM/Clang platform, but now they also work with GCC. Unfortunately not yet with Visual Studio (but you can try Application Verifier). Valgrind Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. When you run a program through Valgrind its run on a virtual machine that emulates your host environment. Having that abstraction the tools can leverage various information about the source code and its execution. http://valgrind.org/ http://valgrind.org/info/about.html http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html HeapTrack HeapTrack is a FOSS project and a heap memory profiler for Linux. It traces all memory allocations and annotates these events with stack traces. The tool has two forms the command line version that grabs the data, and then the UI part that you can use to read and analyze the results. This tool is comparable to Valgrinds massif; its easier to use and should be faster to load and analyze for large projects. https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack Dr. Memory Dr. Memory is an LGPL licenced tool that allows you to monitor and intensify memory -related errors for binaries on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android. Its based on the DynamoRIO dynamic instrumentation tool platform. With the tool, you can find errors like double frees, memory leaks, handle leaks (on Windows), GDI issues, access to uninitialized memory or even errors in multithreading memory scenarios. http://drmemory.org/ https://github.com/DynamoRIO/drmemory Deleaker The primary role of Deleaker is to find leaks in your native applications. It supports Visual Studio (since 2008 till the latest 2019 version), Delphi/C++ Builder, Qt Creator, CLion (soon!). Can be used as an extension in Visual Studio or as a standalone application. Deleaker tracks leaks in C/C++ applications (Native and CLR), plus .NET code. Memory (new/delete, malloc), GDI objects, User32 objects, Handles, File views, Fibres, Critical Sections, and even more. It gathers full call stack, ability to take snapshots, compare them, view source files related to allocation. https://www.deleaker.com/ https://www.deleaker.com/docs/deleaker/tutorial.html Summary & More I hope that with the above list, you get a useful overview of the tools that are essential for C++ development. If you want to read more about other ecosystem elements: libraries, frameworks, and other tools, then please see the full report from Embarcadero: C++ Ecosystem White Paper (Its a nice looking pdf, with more than 20 pages of content!)

        "CLion is an amazing tool -- I've purchased licenses for my personal self in the past, but my employer pays for it these days.<p>My problem is they've done a terrible job of making it scale up to large code bases. I work on the chromium tree -- CLion is completely useless on it.  I have a dual 24-core xeon with 128GB of RAM and SSD and I've given it a wackload of memory, and it becomes completely inoperable, freezing all over the place.<p>Awful because I have such muscle memory for the JetBrains tools, and such a fondness for them.<p>I've gone back to using Emacs, but now with Eclim. I just couldn't get into VSCode.",
        "I had to use Qt as the UI lib for a project, it made me discover that QtCreator was actually not a Qt-only tool but a very good lightweight and generic C++ IDE.<p>That's my choice now. I need something that can navigate easily in a code base, I don't really like learning all the oddities around emacs and vim (even though I am a bit competent at vim) and I don't see what is so bad in using a mouse.<p>At first I thought annoying to have to manually edit the .includes and .config to add the includes and the macro I needed in our complex, hard-to-parse CMake based project, but now I really enjoy the freedom it gives."

GitLab will be initially assisting them with a Proof of Concept to facilitate making an assessment and a decision that will ultimately be consulted with the KDE community. The KDE Community is a free software community dedicated to creating an open and user-friendly computing experience, offering an advanced graphical desktop, a wide variety of applications for communication, work, education and entertainment and a platform to easily build new applications upon. We have a strong focus on finding innovative solutions to old and new problems, creating a vibrant atmosphere open for experimentation. Goals The main goals for a successful migration would be: More accessible infrastructure for contributors Code review integration with git Streamlined infrastructure and tooling Good relationship and open communication channel with upstream (GitLab in this case) Migration issues tracker KDE keeps a list of issues with priorities relevant to the migration at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/57338 Discussion We are at the initial stages of discussion, which can be followed on the notes from our regular calls. KDE is currently looking at a self-hosted solution rather than hosting at gitlab.com.

        "Welcome github // pypi // issue tracker Legit is a complementary command-line interface for Git, optimized for workflow simplicity. It is heavily inspired by GitHub for Mac. Feature branch workflows are dead simple. $ git switch <branch> # Switches to branch. Stashes and restores unstaged changes. $ git sync # Synchronizes current branch. Auto-merge/rebase, un/stash. $ git publish <branch> # Publishes branch to remote server. $ git unpublish <branch> # Removes branch from remote server. $ git branches [wildcard pattern] # Nice & pretty list of branches + publication status. $ git undo [--hard] # Removes the last commit from history.

        "Hi all! We (@anishathalye, @jjgo, and @jonhoo) have long felt that while university CS classes are great at teaching specific topics, they often leave it to students to figure out a lot of the common knowledge about how to actually use your computer. And in particular, how to use it efficiently.<p>There’s just no class in the undergrad curriculum that teaches you how to become familiar with the system you’re working with! Students are expected to know about, or figure out, the shell, editors, remote access and file management, version control, debugging and profiling utilities, and all sorts of other useful tools on their own. Often times, they won’t even know that many of these tools exist, and instead do things in roundabout ways or simply be left frustrated about their development environment.<p>To help mitigate this, we decided to run this short lecture series at MIT during the January Independent Activities Period that we called “Hacker Tools” (in reference to “hacker culture”, not hacking computers). Our hope was that through this class, and the resulting lecture materials and videos, we might be able to bootstrap students’ knowledge about the tools that are available to them, which they can then put to use throughout their time at university, and beyond.<p>We’ve shared both the lecture notes and the recordings of the lectures in the hopes that people outside of MIT may also find these resources useful in making better use of their tools. If that turns out to be true, we’re also thinking of re-doing the videos in screen-cast style with live chat and a proper microphone when we get the time. If that sounds interesting to you, and if you have ideas about other things you’d like to see us cover, please leave a comment below; we’d love to hear from you!<p>We’re sure there are also plenty of cool tools that we didn’t get to cover in this series that you all know and love. Please share them below along with a short description so we can all learn something new!<p>Anish, Jose, and Jon",

        "I read the title as an imperative statement and was disappointed that it’s just yet another GitHub “<i>Awesome list of...</i>”.<p>Was really hoping for an article about building custom tooling as I feel like a lot of my day is spent doing exactly that (ie mini tools to automate recurring semi manual tasks).",
        "These lists are a nice idea, but i do not like the execution - they are little more than a dump of someone's bookmarks. Personally i'd like to see a bit more information about each entry, including screenshots and a short explanation about the program.<p>Something like Softpedia would be great (although simpler), although preferably without garbage reviews like this: <a href=\"https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Coding-languages-Compilers/DMD.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Coding-languages-C...</a> (for a bonus WTF check the screenshot).<p>Alternatively (and probably easier to do) something like tinyapps.org but with a bit more information per entry."

        "When GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018, the company was in crisis. Internally, its culture was toxicand the company was struggling to ship meaningful features or improvements at all. In 2016, I wrote about how frustrated developers, exasperated by the company's ignorance of their pleas to build better tools, took to the platform to write an open letter, a final attempt at getting someone to care. The letter, \"Dear GitHub,\" was a brutal look at how little the company had done to foster the giant, open community, and was opaque about what it paid attention to:Those of us who run some of the most popular projects on GitHub feel completely ignored by you. Weve gone through the only support channel that you have given us either to receive an empty response or even no response at all. We have no visibility into what has happened with our requests, or whether GitHub is working on them. Since our own work is usually done in the open and everyone has input into the process, it seems strange for us to be in the dark about one of our most important project dependencies.At this inflection point, things looked badand it felt like GitHub was going to disappear. There was a time when I wondered what would happen if the world's largest open source community just went out business...but Microsoft has changed that narrative in a short period of time.GitHub, it seems, is thriving again. It just showed the fruits of that labor, and what it looks like when a company is participating in the discussion in the open, listening to the developers that know it best.At an event called GitHub Satellite, the company unveiled the biggest set of new features in memory, all designed to address glaring problems the platform has faced for years. They're designed to help make GitHub a better place to work, and contribute to the open source community as a whole. It started with the small stuff that mattershelping surface who's actually building the packages we use every day with new contributor and dependency tools, that show the people giving back to open source in a bigger way Then, it moved on to the big stuff: how GitHub is building a new way forward. Starting today, there are ways to actually financially support the people building things that we use, and support the work they've often been doing invisibly for free, or for a tiny amount of donations.Open source was always in a dangerous place: many of the things critical technology rely on come from work made available for free on GitHub, and the world's largest companies have built their fortunes atop of these projects without giving back a dollar. Many of these contributors building those tools burn out, or simply can't deal with the load, and sometimes it goes wrong when they step back, ultimating giving the reins to someone else who may not have the same intention. Long term, it wasn't sustainablenor was it a way to build the positive, diverse ecosystem of contributors that open source desperately needs. The tool, called GitHub Sponsor, allow contributors to support a specific person or project directlyand the company doesn't take any sort of cut, commission or fee. Yes, GitHub is swallowing the cost of those transactions entirely to give the creator as much of the money as possible. But, what's even wilder is that it's matching every dollar contributed in the first year, an outrageously bold commitment that's only possible with the backing of a company like Microsoft.With a way to directly support the people behind open source work, built directly into the world's most popular developer platform, we finally have the crucial missing piece to create a healthier way forward for open source. Most importantly, this helps to change the open source narrative: you shouldn't feel like you need to work for free, especially if companies are actually making money off of your work. Sponsorship right there on the page with the installation instructions helps pave the way for companies to actually fund the work they rely on, and that matters. There were a slew of other announcements to push the platform forward, too, from enterprise features for \"internal\" packages, hosted enterprise accounts, better permissions, automated security fixes for vulnerable repositories and much, much more.GitHub finally realized it has an opportunityand a responsibilityto define the way we build the internet's infrastructure. It was always best placed to build a more healthy community, but never stepped up to the platenow it has, and I can't wait to put my money behind the projects that have made my own work possible.But, the most important thing? GitHub showed it's listening, and it's acting. Alongside Microsoft's continued genuine efforts to build the best open developer experience regardless of the tools you use, it's putting its money where its mouth is, and it's good for all of us.GitHub's back. And it's building something for all of us again. Read these next ",

        "Jupyter notebooks are one of the best available tools for running code interactively and writing a narrative with data and plots. What is less known is that they can be conveniently versioned and run automatically.Do you have a Jupyter notebook with plots and figures that you regularly run manually? Wouldnt it be nice to use the same notebook and instead have an automated reporting system, launched from a script? What if this script could even pass some parameters to the notebook it runs?This post explains in a few steps how this can be done concretely, including within a production environment.Example notebookWe will show you how to version control, automatically run and publish a notebook that depends on a parameter. As an example, we will use a notebook that describes the world population and the gross domestic product for a given year. It is simple to use: just change the year variable in the first cell, re-run, and you get the plots for the chosen year. But this requires a manual intervention. It would be much more convenient if the update could be automated and produce a report for each possible value of the year parameter (more generally, a notebook can update its results based not only on some user-provided parameters, but also through a connection to a database, etc.).Version controlIn a professional environment, notebooks are designed by, say, a data scientist, but the task of running them in production may be handled by a different team. So in general people have to share notebooks. This is best done through a version control system.Jupyter notebooks are famous for the difficulty of their version control. Lets consider our notebook above, with a file size of 3 MB, much of it being contributed by the embedded Plotly library. The notebook is less than 80 KB if we remove the output of the second code cell. And as small as 1.75 KB when all outputs are removed. This shows how much of its contents is unrelated to pure code! If we dont pay attention, code changes in the notebook will be lost in an ocean of binary contents.To get meaningful diffs, we use Jupytext (disclaimer: Im the author of Jupytext). Jupytext can be installed with pip or conda. Once the notebook server is restarted, a Jupytext menu appears in Jupyter:We click on Pair Notebook with Markdown, save the notebook and we obtain two representations of the notebook: world_fact.ipynb (with both input and output cells) and world_fact.md (with only the input cells).Jupytexts representation of notebooks as Markdown files is compatible with all major Markdown editors and viewers, including GitHub and VS Code. The Markdown version is for example rendered by GitHub as:As you can see, the Markdown file does not include any output. Indeed, we dont want it at this stage since we only need to share the notebook code. The Markdown file also has a very clear diff history, which makes versioning notebooks simple.The world_facts.md file is automatically updated by Jupyter when you save the notebook. And the other way round also works! If you modify world_facts.md with either a text editor, or by pulling the latest contributions from the version control system, then the changes appear in Jupyter when you refresh the notebook in the browser.In our version control system, we only need to track the Markdown file (and we even explicitly ignore all .ipynb files). Obviously, the team that will execute the notebook needs to regenerate the world_fact.ipynb document. For this they use Jupytext in the command line:$ jupytext world_facts.md --to ipynb[jupytext] Reading world_facts.md[jupytext] Writing world_facts.ipynbWe are now properly versioning the notebook. The diff history is much clearer. See for instance how the addition of the gross domestic products to our report looks like:Jupyter notebooks as Scripts?As an alternative to the Markdown representation, we could have paired the notebook to a world_facts.py script using Jupytext. You should give it a try if your notebook contains more code than text. That's often a first good step towards a complete and efficient refactoring of long notebooks: once the notebook is represented as a script, you can extract any complex code and move it to a (unit-tested) library using the refactoring tools in your IDE.JupyterLab, JupyterHub, Binder, Nteract, Colab & Cloud notebooks?Do you use JupyterLab and not Jupyter Notebook? No worries: the method above also applies in this case. You will just have to use the Jupytext extension for JupyterLab instead of the Jupytext menu. And in case you were wondering, Jupytext also work in JupyterHub and Binder.If you use other notebook editors like Nteract desktop, CoCalc, Google Colab, or another cloud notebook editor, you may not be able to use Jupytext as a plugin in the editor. In this case you can simply use Jupytext in the command line. Close your notebook and inject the pairing information into world_facts.ipynb with$ jupytext --set-formats ipynb,md world_facts.ipynband then keep the two representations synchronised with$ jupytext --sync world_facts.ipynbNotebook parametersPapermill is the reference library for executing notebooks with parameters.Papermill needs to know which cell contains the notebook parameters. This is simply done by adding a parameter tag in that cell with the cell toolbar in Jupyter Notebook:In JupyterLab you can use the celltags extension.And if you prefer you can also directly edit world_facts.md and add the tag there:```python tags=[\"parameters\"]year = 2000```Automated executionWe now have all the information required to execute the notebook on a production server.Production environmentIn order to execute the notebook, we need to know in which environment it should run. As we are working with a Python notebook in this example, we list its dependencies in a requirements.txt file, as is standard for Python projects.For simplicity, we also include the notebook tools in the same environment, i.e. add jupytext and papermill to the same requirements.txt file. Strictly speaking, these tools could be installed and executed in another Python environment.The corresponding Python environment is created with either$ conda create -n run_notebook --file requirements.txt -yor$ pip install -r requirements.txt(if in a virtual environment).Please note that the requirements.txt file is just one way of specifying an execution environment. The Reproducible Execution Environment Specification by the Binder team is one of the most complete references on the subject.Continuous IntegrationIt is a good practice to test each new contribution to either the notebook or its requirements. For this you can use for example Travis CI, a continuous integration solution. You will need only these two commands:pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependenciesjupytext world_facts.md --set-kernel - --execute to test the execution of the notebook in the current Python environment.You can find a concrete example in our .travis.yml file.We are already executing the notebook automatically, arent we? Travis will tell us if a regression is introduced in the project What progress! But were not 100% done yet, as we promised to execute the notebook with parameters.Using the right kernelJupyter notebooks are associated with a kernel (i.e. a pointer to a local Python environment), but that kernel might not be available on your production machine. In this case, we simply update the notebook kernel so as to point to the environment that we have just created:$ jupytext world_facts.ipynb --set-kernel -Note that the minus sign in --set-kernel - above represents the current Python environment. In our example this yields:[jupytext] Reading world_facts.ipynb[jupytext] Updating notebook metadata with '{\"kernelspec\": {\"name\": \"python3\", \"language\": \"python\", \"display_name\": \"Python 3\"}}' [jupytext] Writing world_facts.ipynb (destination file replaced)In case you want to use another kernel just pass the kernel name to the --set-kernel option (you can get the list of all available kernels with jupyter kernelspec list and/or declare a new kernel with python -m ipykernel install --name kernel_name --user).Executing the notebook with parametersWe are now ready to use Papermill for executing the notebook.$ papermill world_facts.ipynb world_facts_2017.ipynb -p year 2017Input Notebook: world_facts.ipynb Output Notebook: world_facts_2017.ipynb 100%|| 8/8 [00:04<00:00, 1.41it/s]Were done! The notebook has been executed and the file world_facts_2017.ipynb contains the outputs.Publishing the NotebookIts time to deliver the notebook that was just executed. Maybe you want it in your mailbox? Or maybe you prefer to get a URL where you can see the result? We cover a few ways of doing that.GitHub can display Jupyter notebooks. This is a convenient solution, as you can easily choose who can access repositories. This works well as long as you dont include any interactive JavaScript plots or widgets in the notebook (the JavaScript parts are ignored by GitHub). In the case of our notebook, the interactive plots do not appear on GitHub, so we need another approach.Another option is to use the Jupyter Notebook Viewer. The nbviewer service can render any notebook which is publicly available on GitHub. Our notebook is thus rendered correctly there. If your notebook is not public, you can choose to install nbviewer locally.Alternatively, you can convert the executed notebook to HTML, and publish it on GitHub pages, or on your own HTML server, or send it over email. Converting the notebook to HTML is easily done with$ jupyter nbconvert world_facts_2017.ipynb --to html[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook world_facts_2017.ipynb to html [NbConvertApp] Writing 3361863 bytes to world_facts_2017.htmlThe resulting HTML file includes the code cells as below:But maybe you dont want to see the input cells in the HTML? You just need to add --no-input:$ jupyter nbconvert --to html --no-input world_facts_2017.ipynb --output world_facts_2017_report.htmlAnd youll get a cleaner report:Sending the standalone HTML file as an attachment in an email is an easy exercise. Embedding the report in the body of the email is also possible (but interactive plots wont work).Finally, if you are looking for a polished report and have some knowledge of LaTeX, you can give the PDF export option of Jupyters nbconvert command a try.Using pipesAn alternative to using named files would be to use pipes. jupytext, nbconvert and papermill all support them. A one-liner substitute for the previous commands is:$ cat world_facts.md \\ | jupytext --from md --to ipynb --set-kernel - \\ | papermill -p year 2017 \\ | jupyter nbconvert --stdin --output world_facts_2017_report.htmlConclusionYou should now be able to set up a full pipeline for generating reports in production, based on Jupyter notebooks. We have seen how to:version control a notebook with Jupytextshare a notebook and its dependencies between various userstest a notebook with continuous integrationexecute a notebook with parameters using Papermilland finally, how to publish the notebook (on GitHub or nbviewer), or render it as a static HTML page.The technology used in this example is fully based on the Jupyter Project, which is the de facto standard for Data Science. The tools used here are all open source and work well with any continuous integration framework.You have everything you need to schedule and deliver fine-tuned, code-free reports!EpilogueThe tools used here are written in Python. But they are language agnostic. Thanks to the Jupyter framework, they actually apply to any of the 40+ programming language for which a Jupyter kernel exists.Now, imagine that you have authored a document containing a few Bash command lines, just like this blog post. Install Jupytext and the bash kernel, and the blog post becomes this interactive Jupyter notebook!Going further, shouldnt we make sure that every instruction in our post actually works? We do that via our continuous integration spoiler alert: thats as simple as jupytext --execute README.md!AcknowledgmentsMarc would like to thank Eric Lebigot and Florent Zara for their contributions to this article, and to CFM for supporting this work through their Open-Source Program.About the authorThis article was written by Marc Wouts.

It even allows recording of commit messages. Why? I saw the following passage in diff(1) of 7th Edition UNIX: The -e option produces a script of a, c and d commands for the editor ed, which will recreate file2 from file1. The -f option produces a similar script, not useful with ed, in the opposite order. In connection with -e, the following shell program may help maintain multiple versions of a file. Only an ancestral file ($1) and a chain of version-to-version ed scripts ($2,$3,...) made by diff need be on hand. A `latest version' appears on the standard output.

        "In 2016, hackers gained access to Ubers private code repositories and used hard-coded credentials to exfiltrate 57 million driver records from an AWS S3 bucket. As a result of this breach, and its subsequent cover-up, Uber was fined $148 million. Could they have prevented such an incident? If this can happen to Uber, it can happen to any other company.Source code hosting providers such as GitHub and GitLab have socialized software development, making it easier to collaborate on projects & ship code quickly. But this hasnt been without consequences: its led to an increase in the accidental publication of sensitive information such as API keys, secrets, and credentials. This sensitive information can range from SSH keys to API keys, and even passwords. After analyzing millions of commits, our research team found that this problem is widespread and occurs daily as new commits are pushed up as part of the software development lifecycle. Abuse of these leaked credentials can cause salient security & compliance risks, such as catastrophic loss of sensitive customer data, harming an organization both financially and reputationally, while putting consumers at risk.When asked about the Uber leak, GitHub had the following comment:Our recommendation is to never store access tokens, passwords, or other authentication or encryption keys in the code. If the developer must include them in the code, we recommend they implement additional operational safeguards to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.Even AWS, the largest cloud provider by market share, has been financially impacted by leaked AWS keys and was motivated to create Git-secrets to help combat this problem. However, they acknowledge the difficulty of this problem, and even they cannot guarantee fool-proof detection of their own AWS keys. Many organizations have become hyper-aware of the potential risks of credential leakage, so related open source tools are gaining popularity on platforms like GitHub despite their low accuracy rates.Our team has been evaluating existing tools, and weve built a solution that leverages machine learning to dramatically improve the chances of accurately detecting credentials in your source code. Read on to learn more.We evaluated several popular tools used today to protect and secure GitHub repositories:truffleHog, 3k+ stars on GitHub Searches through git repositories for high entropy strings and secrets, digging deep into commit historyGitrob, 3k+ stars on GitHub Reconnaissance tool for GitHub organizationsGitleaks, 4k+ start on GitHub Audit git repos for secretsGit-secrets, 5k+ stars on GitHub Prevents you from committing secrets and credentials into git repositoriesIts worth noting that we focused on the most popular open source projects there are other projects like Yelps detect-secrets and Auth0s repo-supervisor that serve a similar purpose, though we didnt include them in this analysis to avoid redundancy. Well provide a brief introduction of each tool, an analysis of their pros & cons, followed by a more detailed comparison with examples. If youre already familiar with common tools and are curious about our approach, feel free to skip ahead to the section titled Our Approach: Radar below.The two main algorithms used in these tools are entropy and regular expressions:Entropy: Shannon entropy, or information entropy, is the average rate at which information is produced by a stochastic source of data. A high entropy score is the result of high variability of information, e.g. a string with only one repetitive character will have low entropy, since there is only one state, and can be converted to 1 bit of information. On the other hand, a string with a diverse set of characters that appears highly random, such as API keys, will require more bits to transmit, having much higher entropy. See here for more info.Regular Expressions (Regex): A regular expression, or regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Regexes are used to perform any lexical searching to match a variable name or API key pattern. See here for more info.truffleHogtruffleHog is an open-source tool written in Python that searches through git commit history for credentials/secrets that are accidentally committed.Pros:truffleHog scans the whole history of branches and commits, thus nothing will be missed if committed.truffleHog allows for both regex based and high entropy based flagging.Users can provide custom regexes to suit their needs accordingly.Cons:High entropy is a commonly used method to detect randomly generated API keys in many tools. However, because of the lack of contextual awareness, this method tends to be noisy. For example, it can be hard to distinguish between long variable names and credentials, e.g. TestScrapeLoopRunReportsTargetDownOnInvalidUTF8 which is a high-entropy string and would likely get flagged as a false positive.Regular expressions are a powerful but limited method that searches for generic patterns. Thus, they only work well on finding keys with explicitly defined & repeatable patterns, e.g. starting with some fixed characters, or very lengthy keys. Requiring these unique characteristics dramatically reduces the pool of potential tokens that can be flagged accurately.GitrobGitrob is an open-source tool written in Go that helps find potentially sensitive files. Different than the other tools listed, it has a broader range of object detection beyond API keys.Pros:Similar to truffleHog, it drills deep into the commit history of a repository, and the user can adjust how far back in the commit history to scan.The UI is very friendly for users to manipulate and analyze results.Also provides regex for searching for generic keys, e.g. /([a-f09\\-\\$\\/]{20,})/gmi.Cons:The search mechanisms are fairly simple mainly keyword searching, which yields many false positives. Users have to manually go through all detected files and tokens to check if they contain valid sensitive info or not, which can be very time-consuming.The regex for API keys does not have a cap on the length of the key, which can lead to a high number of false positives and is not comprehensive enough to capture keys with more diverse character sets.GitleaksGitleaks is an open-source tool written in Go that provides a way to find unwanted data types in code checked in to git. Imprecisely, its a Go version of truffleHog, although algorithm-wise, there are unique aspects.Pros:It combines a regex list similar to truffleHog and a high entropy method to do credential detection.It offers the user options to adjust their regex list and entropy range.Cons:Similar to truffleHog.Git-secretsGit-secrets is a tool written in bash to prevent users from committing AWS API keys.Pros:The tools main methods only occupy one file, so the code is easy to understand, use, and extend.Cons:The searching domain is limited to several regexes for AWS keys.Poses potential risks missing real AWS API keys if the users variable name does not match Git-secrets regexes, which is a common problem for all regex based searching methods. In other words, Git-secrets detection mandates that the AWS secret key must have key in the variable name, so a change of the variable name to aws_secret or secret_token would not trigger the regex, leading to a false negative.While all the tools mentioned have their respective differentiators, they all have common limitations in their search mechanisms that severely limit their accuracy. On the one hand, searching for keys using regexes might provide high signal for distinctive API key patterns such as Google ( AZia*) or Slack ( xoxp-*) keys, however, other patterns such as MongoDBs are indistinguishable from a universally unique identifier ( UUID). The regex results can also be quite noisy in that they match a lot of hashes/SHAs as well. On the other hand, Shannon entropy is a more comprehensive search method, but due to the sheer quantity of its output, it yields a high degree of false positives, making it untenable to use at scale.Since most approaches in this domain have mainly been a mixture of regexes and Shannon entropy, which each have their respective shortcomings, our team sought to develop a novel method leveraging deep learning to overcome the limitations of these methods.Here well introduce our deep learning based approach, called Radar, trained on features extracted from a broad set of API key patterns and their surrounding context in code. Utilizing contextual information is not a novel idea even regex based methods attempt this by looking backward for high-value words. However, our model approaches this problem in a more comprehensive way. Other solutions are based upon detection techniques that leverage heuristics around variable naming conventions, but this approach is rigid and brittle.For example, consider the generic API key regex in truffleHog:/[a|A][p|P][i|I][_]?[k|K][e|E][y|Y].*['|\\\"][0-9a-zA-Z]{32,45}['|\\\"]/Now, consider the following sample code:api_key = '12345678901234567890123456789012' api_token = '12345678901234567890123456789012'In this code example, when applying truffleHogs regex, the API key in the first line will be captured, while the second will not. This demonstrates that regex searching is limited to the lexical format of the code. Because variable naming conventions differ from developer to developer, this can easily lead to situations where designed regexes do not match the variable names that a regex is searching for. Abiding by naming conventions to be compliant with a regexs rules would not be too difficult, but as a prerequisite, developers would need to read the source code to understand and identify all situations that the tool would work well in.We dont believe tools should dictate and constrain how developers work instead the optimal tool should fit their existing workflow. The way that we deal with the problem of naming variation is that we dont require situations to be lexically similar they only need to be semantically similar. In other words, it shouldnt matter if the variable name is access_token or access_key since they have the same meaning.A deeper technical dive of our model will be done in a subsequent post. If youre eager to try out Radar on GitHub repos, feel free to jump ahead to Announcing the Radar API below.In this section, we evaluate the performance of our model against the tools mentioned above by scanning a sample code repository that mimics the potential occurrence of API keys in the real world. This was done to confirm our understanding of the algorithm in each tool, and to present visual examples of their advantages and limitations.We copied over ten real-world examples that we collected during the scanning process and also added nine ambiguous examples, which represent different misleading situations that can yield false positive detections.We highlighted the results found from each detector. True positives are highlighted in green. False positives are highlighted in red. We evaluated precision, recall and F1 score to quantify & compare model performance.For reference, precision is the fraction of correctly predicted positive instances among all predicted instances. Recall is the fraction of correctly predicted instances over total number of positive instances. F1 score is an overall measure of a models accuracy that combines precision and recall.truffleHogFirst, we scanned the repo with truffleHogs regex method.Precision: 3/3, Recall: 3/10.F1: 46%As mentioned, truffleHog has two regex patterns for capturing generic/application agnostic API keys, this pattern captures an alphanumeric token between 32 and 45 characters with a variable name containing apikey or secret.We next scanned the repo with truffleHogs Entropy method.Precision: 10/17, Recall: 10/10.F1: 74%truffleHogs high entropy method doesnt check variable names, it only calculates the Shannon entropy for each token and therefore, is quite noisy. When considering the low ratio of real API keys to false positives in real-world scenarios (<1:100), the number of results from this algorithm can be overwhelming to review.GitleaksCommand: gitleaks repo-path=./ verbosePrecision: 1/1, Recall: 1/10.F1: 18%Gitleaks is similar to truffleHog, in that it mainly uses regexes to detect credentials; however, their regexes are slightly non-traditional. For example, Gitleaks only captures api_key_github, which is an uncommon variable naming convention. The name github_api_key is the more common variable name people would assign to a GitHub API key. Nonetheless, almost all available tools support adding custom regexes into their regex list so this will not be a major issue if users adjust or input regexes to meet their needs.GitrobPrecision: 8/14, Recall: 8/10.F1: 66%Its hard to directly compare Gitrob to other tools because it effectively captures all strings longer than 20 characters, within the character set [a-fA-F09], and requires users to manually go through the results to check if they are valid. Gitrob provides a nice UI so that the user can easily go through each file.Watchtower RadarPrecision: 9/10, Recall: 9/10.F1: 90%Because Radar incorporates more comprehensive features as noted above, the false negative rate and false positive rate are both quite low, enhancing the user experience when verifying results.Its important to note that this test repository was created internally, and results will vary across repositories that are scanned. There are trade-offs to any of the approaches above, each with their own merits. As such, we have released Radar as an API that you can use to scan GitHub repositories for sensitive credentials. The service is free to use for the first 5 scans, so please feel free to try it here radar.watchtower.ai by logging in with GitHub. Note that the service scans both public and private repos, and does not store or track sensitive findings. Radar scans the full commit history for repos that have 1000 unique commits or fewer. For larger repos, Radar scans the current working directory (i.e. the latest version of the files in the default branch). To scan the full commit history of repos larger than 1000 commits, or to increase your scan limit, please contact us via email at support@watchtower.ai. You can also schedule a demo via our website at www.watchtower.ai.Start a ScanFor example, after logging in, you can start a new scan of public GitHub repo via the command line:curl https://radar.watchtower.ai/api/v1/scans/new \\-u API_KEY: \\-d 'public_github_url=https://github.com/watchtowerdlp/sample'This will run the scan asynchronously, and youll be notified when the results are ready to view:{ \"id\": \"0b6b08cf-f1ff-436b-a69f-7a1cb0d06e44\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/watchtowerdlp/sample\", \"duration\": \"0.822404097\", \"created_at\": \"2019-04-28 22:51:10 UTC\", \"scanned_files\": 24, \"status_code\": 200, \"results_count\": 1, \"results\": [ { \"result_id\": \"db2d2f85-8c06-41ef-85bf-2ea2dc786ca3\", \"repo_path\": \"sample\", \"file_path\": \"sample.rb\", \"branch\": \"origin/master\", \"commit_hash\": \"3a07b08d2461b6906376081d1f13b303215bf55d\", \"author_email\": \"49463194+watchtowerdlp@users.noreply.github.com\", \"context\": \"a4300836696c47b4f2d7c'\\n+\\n+auth_token = '\", \"token\": \"db\", \"token_length\": 32, \"permalink\": \"https://github.com/watchtowerdlp/sample/blob/3a07b08d2461b6906376081d1f13b303215bf55d/sample.rb#L7\", \"created_at\": \"2019-04-28 22:51:13 UTC\" } ]}Likewise, you can configure a webhook endpoint to be programmatically notified when the scan is complete and results are available for review. If you prefer, you can also view scan results in the dashboard, screenshots below. You can read the complete API docs here: radar.watchtower.ai.View scans in the dashboard:As well as their results:Its worth noting that during the course of our research we noticed that most keys that we found were stored deep in the commit history of a repo or were included in a now-deleted file. In git, deleting files with sensitive data, or deleting the tokens themselves, is actually only at the surface level, and the secrets can still be dug up in the commit history. As such, the only effective way to remove these keys is to delete the commit that introduced the key or to delete the entire commit history and start a brand new history. As such a detection tool like Radar could be applied as part of an engineers CI/CD workflow before any code gets pushed to a remote repo to prevent the need to edit the git history. This proactive approach would be instrumental in reducing the accidental exposure of secrets. Contact us if youre interested in leveraging Radar in this way.To increase your scan limit, or scan the full commit history of larger repos, please email us at support@watchtower.ai.

See how easy it istoinstall Lefthook, recently adopted by Discourse, Logux, andOpenstax, for most common frontend andbackend environments andensure all developers onyour team can rely onasingle flexible tool. Andit also has emojis Days, when asingle piece ofsoftware that millions rely onwas created by asingle developer inanivory tower, are long gone. Even Git, universally believed tobethebrainchild ofLinus Torvalds alone, was created with thehelp ofcontributors andisnow being maintained by ateam ofdozens. No matter ifyou work onanopen source project with thewhole world being your oyster, oryou are blooming inawalled garden ofproprietary commercial softwareyou still work inateam. Andeven with awell-organized system ofpull requests andcode reviews maintaining thecode quality across thelarge codebase with dozens ofcontributors isnot aneasy task. Hook me up Hooksways tofire off custom scripts when certain important actions (commit, push, etc.) occurare baked right into Git, so ifyou are comfortable with Bash andtheinternals oftheworld most popular version control systemyou dont need any external tools per se: just edit ./.git/hooks/pre-commit andput insome well-formed script that will, for instance, lint your files before you commit. However, when you work onaproject, you are most interested inwriting projects codenot thecode that checks it. Intheworld ofmodern web development tooling iseverything, andmyriads oftools exist for asingle reason: reducing overhead andcomplexity. Git hooks are not theexception: inJavaScript community, theweapon ofchoice isHusky with Webpack, Babel, andcreate-react-app relying onthis Node-based tool; Rails-centric backend world, however, ismostly ruled by Overcommit that comes as aRuby gem. Find detailed comparisons ofLefthook with other tools intheprojects wiki. Both tools are excellent intheir regard, but inamixed team offrontend andbackend developers, as Evil Martians are, you will often end up having two separate setups for Ruby andJavaScript with frontenders andbackenders linting their commits each intheir way. With Lefthook, you dont need tothink twiceits asingle Go binary that has wrappers both for JavaScript andfor Ruby. It can also beused as astandalone tool for any other environment. For most common use cases, Lefthook requires zero setup. Go language makes Lefthook lightning-fast andprovides support for concurrently executed scripts out ofthebox. Thefact that theexecutable isasingle machine code binary also removes theneed for minding external dependencies (Husky + lint-staged add roughly fifteen hundred dependencies toyour node_modules). It also removes theheadache ofreinstalling dependencies after each update ofyour development environment (try running aglobally installed Ruby gem with another version ofRuby). With Lefthook mentioned either inpackage.json orGemfile, andalefthook.yml configured intheprojects root (see examples below) thetool will beinstalled andused against your code automatically onthenext git pull, yarn install/ bundle install andgit add/git commitwith zero overhead for new contributors. An extensive README describes all possible usage scenarios. Thestraightforward syntax for configuration does not hide actual commands being run by Lefthookmaking sure that nothing funny ishappening below thebelt. Discourse with apunch Discoursean incredibly popular open source platform for forum-style discussionshas recently transitioned from Overcommit toLefthook andnever looked back. With almost 700 contributors authoring 34K commits andcounting, running linters onall new contributions isapriority. With Overcommit though, team members had toremind newcomers toinstall required tools continually Now with @arkweid/lefthook being adev dependency intheprojects package.json, nosetup isnecessary for new contributors. Lefthook allowed tohalf theamount oftime that pre-commit scripts take onlocalhost. The PR that changed theGit hook manager required, inessence, changing .overcommit.yml tolefthook.yml. Ifyou compare themyou will see that Lefthooks configuration ismuch more explicit while theOvercommits one relies mostly onthemagic ofplugins. Discourses CI output before andafter Lefthook Besides changing theway theoutput looksLefthook offers anice summary ofeverything it doesLefthook allowed tohalf theamount oftime that pre-commit scripts take onlocalhost, andincrease theCI run by 20% (on CI environments with better support for parallel execution thegain can beconsiderably more). A pretty bonus Round one Everything Lefthook needs tofunctionis alefthook binary installed somewhere inyour system (either globally orlocally), andalefthook.yml file inaproject root. The binary can either beinstalled globally (with Homebrew for macOS, snap for Ubuntu, AUR for Arch, orgo get anywhere), orlisted as adevelopment dependency either inRubys Gemfile, orNode.js package.json. If you are configuring Lefthook for thefirst time inyour projectyou need tochoose between these options, depending onyour preferences. Themain upside ofputting lefthook inyour Gemfile or@arkweid/lefthook inyour package.json isthat you dont need toworry that your contributors may not have lefthook installed system-wideafter thenext bundle install oryarn install thebinary will beinplace. After you have lefthook inyour systemrun lefthook install intheprojects root togenerate lefthook.yml andvisit theprojects repo for examples onhow touse thesyntax, here isaparticularly full one. Here ishow thecode describing actions oneach pre-commit (right after you type git commit -m \"new feature\" but right before it gets committed) might look like: pre-commit: commands: stylelint: tags: frontend style glob: \"*.{js}\" run: yarn stylelint {staged_files} rubocop: tags: backend style glob: \"*.{rb}\" exclude: \"application.rb|routes.rb\" run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files} scripts: \"good_job.js\": runner: node Then commit lefthook.yml toyour repository andpush it toyour favorite remotenow everyone onyour team will see it inaction every time they commit code. Blow by blow If you want tocheck Lefthook out onademo project quicklywe recommend cloning theevil_chat repositorya project we build inour celebrated Modern Frontend inRails series ofposts (Pt. 1, Pt. 2, Pt. 3). In this project, we use pre-commit hooks configured with Lefthook for formatting JavaScript andCSS files with Prettier, andlinting them with ESlint andstylelint. Heres how toquickly see Lefthook inaction. First, clone therepo andrun package managers: $ git clone git@github.com:demiazz/evil_chat.git $ bundle && yarn Now, go andbreak some CSS orJS inany .pcss or.js files. $ git add . && git commit -m \"Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds\" Wait for it! If all goes well (meaning you succeeded inbreaking thecode), this iswhat you are going tosee: A bad commit The failing scripts are shown with aboxing glove emoji ontheoutputgiving you areal left hook tobring back your attention! For now, our linting covers only thefrontend part oftheapp. What about adding some good old Rubocop tothemix? Edit your lefthook.yml toinclude thefollowing lines: # lefthook.yml pre-commit: parallel: true # tell Lefthook to utilise all cores commands: js: glob: \"*.js\" run: yarn prettier --write {staged_files} && yarn eslint {staged_files} && git add {staged_files} css: glob: \"*.{css,pcss}\" run: yarn prettier --write {staged_files} && yarn stylelint --fix {staged_files} && git add {staged_files} # Add these lines rubocop: glob: \"*.{rb}\" run: rubocop {staged_files} --parallel Note thehandy {staged_files} shortcut that allows you totarget only thefiles that are staged for acurrent commit. Now go back tofix your JS andCSS andcommit astyle offense inany oftheRuby files (yes, you have our permission). Feel free tothrow insome comments here andthere so that git picks up changes for different filetypes. Rubocop comes into play Now CSS andJS are fine, but Ruby needs another look, hence theleft hook! Roll with thepunches Here isthesummary ofthefeatures that make Lefthook stand out ofcompetition, andbring flexibility toyour workflow, see thecomplete list here. Speed Lefthook squeezes out every bit ofparallelism from your machine (or aCI server), you only need totoggle one setting: parallel: true. Heres theconfig file that describes alint series ofcommands that you can run with lefthook run lint from your command line. These are thesame commands that Discourse used torun onTravis. Lefthook gives you anability torun custom tasks like that. As analternative, you can set thesame commands toberun onpre-commit, pre-push, post-checkout, post-merge, orany other available Git hooks. # lefthook.yml lint: # parallel: true commands: rubocop: run: bundle exec rubocop --parallel prettier: run: yarn prettier --list-different \"app/assets/stylesheets/**/*.scss\" \"app/assets/javascripts/**/*.es6\" \"test/javascripts/**/*.es6\" eslint-assets: run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 app/assets/javascripts eslint-test: run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 test/javascripts eslint-plugins-assets: run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 plugins/**/assets/javascripts eslint-plugins-test: run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 plugins/**/test/javascripts eslint-assets-tests: run: yarn eslint app/assets/javascripts test/javascripts With parallel: true commented out, onmy system, this task takes over 30 seconds. With theparallel feature turned on, it takes 15.5 secondstwice as fast! Flexibility Direct control If you want torun your hook directly, without waiting for aGit action: $ lefthook run pre-commit Flexible lists offiles You can use built-in shortcuts {staged_files} and{all_files}, ordefine your own lists according tospecific selection. pre-commit: commands: frontend-linter: run: yarn eslint {staged_files} backend-linter: run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files} frontend-style: files: git diff --name-only HEAD @{push} run: yarn stylelint {files} Glob/Regex filters If you want tofilter alist offiles onthefly with aglob oraRegex. pre-commit: commands: backend-linter: glob: \"*.{rb}\" # glob filter exclude: \"application.rb|routes.rb\" # regexp filter run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files} Run your own scripts If one-liners are not enough, you can tell Lefthook toexecute custom scripts. commit-msg: scripts: \"good_job\": runner: bash Tags andlocal config for even more flexibility You can group your tasks by tags andthen exclude them when you run hooks locally (e.g., you are abackend developer andnot interested inrunning tasks onfrontend code). With Lefthook, you can create alefthook-local.yml file inyour project root (dont forget toadd it toyour .gitignore): all thesettings described here would override theones from themain lefthook.yml. Now you can assign tags todifferent series ofcommands # lefthook.yml pre-push: commands: stylelint: tags: frontend-style # a tag files: git diff --name-only master glob: \"*.{js}\" run: yarn stylelint {files} rubocop: tags: backend-style # a tag files: git diff --name-only master glob: \"*.{rb}\" run: bundle exec rubocop {files} andexclude them from being run locally: # lefthook-local.yml pre-push: exclude_tags: - frontend-style K.O. Do you use Docker for local development? Perhaps you do, perhaps not yet, but there isabig chance that someone else onyour team does otherwise. Some people embrace containerized development fully, while others prefer torely onwell-groomed local environments. Your main lefthook.yml may contain thefollowing: post-push: scripts: \"good_job.js\": runner: bash However, you want torun thesame task inaDocker container, but you dont want tomess up thesetup for everyone else. By using alefthook-local.yml file (the one you dont check ininto version control), you can alter thecommand just slightly, andjust for your local setup, by using a{cmd} shortcut, just like that: # lefthook-local.yml pre-commit: scripts: \"good_job.js\": runner: docker exec -it --rm <container_id_or_name> {cmd} {cmd} will bereplaced by acommand from themain config. The resulting command will look like this: docker exec -it --rm <container_id_or_name> node good_job.js 8 9 10 Knockout!
