        "story_title":"During a Solar Eclipse, What Are Plants Doing?",
        "url_text":"TrilobitesResearch conducted during the Great American Eclipse of 2017 suggested the suns midday disappearance shocked some plants.Credit...Dr. Mario BretfeldJuly 2, 2019As the total solar eclipse crosses South America on Tuesday, it wont just be people oohing and ahhing as the sun is blotted out.Other living things will have their own responses, too some of which we are just beginning to understand. As some scientists used the Great American Eclipse in August 2017 to watch how bees and birds dealt with sudden midday darkness, researchers in Wyoming investigated big sagebrush, a shaggy, aromatic desert shrub that grows throughout the western United States.Tracking its reactions at the leaf level, scientists saw it experience a slowdown in activity as darkness fell, followed by shock at the suns surprise return. The study, published in June in Scientific Reports, adds to a small clump of botanical eclipse research, all produced by people with the ability to wonder, even as a celestial event occurs: What are the plants getting up to?[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Plants havent really been well-documented during the eclipse, said Daniel Beverly, a Ph.D. student in botany and hydrology at the University of Wyoming and the papers lead author. When he heard an eclipse was coming, he saw the chance for a once-in-a-lifetime data set.Big sagebrush spends much of its life in the sun, and it covers such a large portion of the country, from Oregon down to New Mexico, Mr. Beverly said, making it a good subject for study. He and his colleagues chose a patch close to Yellowstone National Park. They set up instruments that could measure photosynthetic rate, as well as the speed of transpiration how quickly its leaves lose water.As the light faded and the temperature dropped during the 80 or so minutes before totality, Mr. Beverly and his team saw a corresponding decrease in photosynthesis and transpiration. The plant responded as if it was dusk, he said.During the two minutes and 18 seconds of complete darkness, both rates fell further. Although they did not quite reach the slowdown level of an average nighttime, it was a much more precipitous drop than would have occurred for a passing cloud.But when the sun appeared again, the shrubs were blindsided.Thats when we saw the most evident signals of stress, said Mr. Beverly. It caused a disruption in the photosynthetic pathways.Although they could not test this directly, he guesses that the shock of sudden sunlight messed with each plants circadian rhythm the internal clock that determines an organisms daily cycle of activity.Over the course of the eclipse day, the team estimated, your average big sagebrush managed about 14 percent less photosynthesis than it would have if the sun hadnt been blocked. If a plant is already drought-stressed, an eclipse might be bad news, like losing 14 percent of a days income when youre already broke, Mr. Beverly said.Their findings follow a few other studies, including one done during an eclipse over Europe in 1999 that showed changes in sap flow and transpiration in a beech tree near Ghent, Belgium. The tree held its breath during the solar eclipse, said Kathy Steppe, now a professor of plant ecology at Ghent University meaning it stopped releasing water, even as its sap kept flowing.Mr. Beverly looks forward to the 2024 eclipse, which will sweep from Mexico through to the Eastern United States, when he plans to take a closer look at crop and tree responses.Hell do one thing differently: I would try to use as much automation as possible so I could actually enjoy the eclipse, he said. Thats a big thing I missed. "},

        "url_text":"The meteorite impact caused a bright flash, indicated by the arrowJose M. Madiedo Observers of Mondays lunar eclipse were blessed with the first known sighting of a meteorite impact during such an event. The so-called super wolf blood moon was eagerly watched by millions of people around the world, mostly via live streaming video.During the eclipse,some people noticed a tiny flash, a brief yellow-white speck, popping up on the lunar surface during the online broadcasts. One Reddit user raised the possibility that this was a meteorite impactand othersscoured eclipse footage for evidence of the event. A flash is visible in at least three different videos.Advertisement Jose Maria Madiedo at the University of Huelva in Spain has confirmed that the impact is genuine.For years,he and his colleagues have been hoping to observe a meteorite impact on the moon during a lunar eclipse, but the brightness of these events can make that very difficult lunar meteorite impacts have been filmed before, but not during an eclipse. Read more: NASA puzzles over invisible moon impact On this occasion, Madiedo doubled the number of telescopes trained on different parts of the moon from four to eight in the hope of seeing an impact. I had a feeling, this time will be the time it will happen, says Madiedo. After the eclipse, software automatically pinpointed a flash in imagery recorded by several of his telescopes. This helps to confirm that the flashes seen by live stream-watchers were not just optical anomalies on camera sensors. I was really, really happy when this happened, says Madiedo. He notes that the flash was quite bright and it struck the moon at a moment when the eclipse was not overly luminous itself, perhaps making the strike easier to detect. Although he has not yet formally calculated an estimate for the size of the space rock that collided with the moon, Madiedo thinks it probably had a mass of about 2 kilograms and was roughly the size of a football. Experience Argentinas 2020 total solar eclipse: Witness a rare celestial event on a New Scientist Discovery Tour The combination of a darkened surface and a lot of people watching made it much more likely that the flash of impact was seen and it reminds us that the solar system is still a very dynamic place, says Robert Massey at the Royal Astronomical Society. Article amended on 23 January 2019 When this article was first published it included a video of a collision recorded in December 2018. It has been replaced with the correct video showing the January meteorite impact during the lunar eclipse.
