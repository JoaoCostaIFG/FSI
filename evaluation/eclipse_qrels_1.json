    "story_text": "At work, I was asked to learn spring boot and the first task was to build a simple crud app, just end to end functionality for a model with automated tests, builds, static code analysis etc. I hate to admit it, but for the first few days (and even now) I couldn't tell which was up and which way was down, nothing made sense.<p>- Installation was a nightmare. Workplace uses windows, so the usual dance of installing the jdk, setting the env variables, creating a project in eclipse and for some reason it uses the jre instead of the jdk. Some plugins/packages such as lombok work in eclipse but not in vs code! And even in eclipse there's some annotation (@Data I think) that's supposed to generate getters and setters but it doesn't work.<p>- Flexible architecture : some use service, serviceimpl and controllers. Some skip the service interface. And it turns out you can extend crudrepository and have a fully functioning rest endpoint without writing any code using spring data rest!<p>- Magic : this is incredibly frustrating. Some repository types are automatically exported, some are not and the docs do an atrocious job of explaing what's going on. Place some file abc.xyz in the root and magic happens!<p>- Docs : the single worst part of learning spring boot, especially for newcomers. How can the docs possibly be so insensitive to newcomers? Or do they expect only experienced devs at big cos to use spring boot?<p>- I hate to admit this, but I still don't know what a god damn bean is, what AOP is, what inversion of control is.<p>This was mainly a rant and a bad one at that, but I had to vent."

    "story_title": "Ghidra source code officially released",
    "url_text": "Ghidra Software Reverse Engineering Framework Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the National Security Agency Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra extension components and/or scripts using Java or Python. In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and generating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential vulnerabilities in networks and systems. If you are a U.S. citizen interested in projects like this, to develop Ghidra and other cybersecurity tools for NSA to help protect our nation and its allies, consider applying for a career with us. Install To install an official pre-built multi-platform Ghidra release: Install JDK 11 64-bit Download a Ghidra release file Extract the Ghidra release file Launch Ghidra: ./ghidraRun (or ghidraRun.bat for Windows) For additional information and troubleshooting tips about installing and running a Ghidra release, please refer to docs/InstallationGuide.html which can be found in your extracted Ghidra release directory. Build To create the latest development build for your platform from this source repository: Install build tools: JDK 11 64-bit Gradle 6 or 7 make, gcc, and g++ (Linux/macOS-only) Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows-only) Download and extract the source: Download from GitHub $ unzip ghidra-master $ cd ghidra-master NOTE: Instead of downloading the compressed source, you may instead want to clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra.git Download additional build dependencies into source repository: $ gradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle init Create development build: The compressed development build will be located at build/dist/. For more detailed information on building Ghidra, please read the Developer Guide. Develop User Scripts and Extensions Ghidra installations support users writing custom scripts and extensions via the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse. The plugin and its corresponding instructions can be found within a Ghidra release at Extensions/Eclipse/GhidraDev/. Advanced Development To develop the Ghidra tool itself, it is highly recommended to use Eclipse, which the Ghidra development process has been highly customized for. Install build and development tools: Follow the above build instructions so the build completes without errors Install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Prepare the development environment: $ gradle prepdev eclipse buildNatives Import Ghidra projects into Eclipse: File -> Import... General | Existing Projects into Workspace Select root directory to be your downloaded or cloned ghidra source repository Check Search for nested projects Click Finish When Eclipse finishes building the projects, Ghidra can be launched and debugged with the provided Ghidra Eclipse run configuration. For more detailed information on developing Ghidra, please read the Developer Guide. Contribute If you would like to contribute bug fixes, improvements, and new features back to Ghidra, please take a look at our Contributor Guide to see how you can participate in this open source project.

    "url_text": "Finally an image of X-37B / OTV-5 Space Plane Taken by Ralf Vandebergh on July 2, 2019 @ the Netherlands Click photo for larger image Camera Used: Unavailable UnavailableExposure Time: UnavailableAperture: UnavailableISO: UnavailableDate Taken: Unavailable More images Details: I have been hunting for the OTV-5 since months and saw it visually in May. When I tried to observe it again mid June, it didn't meet the predicted time and path. It turned out to have maneuvered to another orbit. Thanks to the amateur satellite observers-network, it was rapidly found in orbit again and I was able to take some images on June 30 and July 2. This most recent pass was almost overhead. The OTV is a small version of the classic Space Shuttle, it is really a small object, even at only 300 km altitude, so don't expect the detail level of ground based images of the real Space Shuttle. Considering this, the attached images succeeded beyond expectations. We can recognize a bit of the nose, Payload Bay and tail of this mini-shuttle with even a sign of some smaller detail. Images were taken through a 10 inch F/4,8 aperture Newtonian telescope with an Astrolumina ALccd 5L-11 mono CMOS camera. Tracking was fully manually through a 6x30 finderscope.

    "url_text": "Download PDF Abstract: Open source projects have an increasing importance on modern software development. For this reason, these projects, as usual with commercial software projects, should make use of promotion channels to communicate and establish contact with users and contributors. In this article, we study the channels used to promote a set of 100 popular GitHub projects. First, we reveal that Twitter, user meetings, and blogs are the most common promotion channels used by the studied projects. Second, we report a major difference between the studied projects and a random sample of projects, regarding the use of the investigated promotion channels. Third, we show the importance of a popular news aggregation site (Hacker News) on the promotion of open source. We conclude by presenting a set of practical recommendation to open source project managers and leaders, regarding the promotion of their projects.
